> Behold, then, O Lord, my abjection and frailty every way known to thee.
>
> Have pity on me, and draw me out of the mire, that I stick not fast therein, that I may not be utterly cast down for ever.
>
> This it is which often drives me back, and confounds me in thy sight, to find that I am so subject to fall, and have so little strength to resist my passions.
>
> And although I do not altogether consent, yet their assaults are troublesome and grievous to me; and it is exceedingly irksome to live thus always in a conflict.
>
> From hence my infirmity is made known to me; because wicked thoughts do always much more easily rush in upon me, than they can be cast out again.
