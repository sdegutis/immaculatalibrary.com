> *ANOTHER INSTANCE OF BLESSED FRANCISâ€™ GENTLENESS WITH HIS OWN SERVANTS.*
> 
> Like master, like man. Not only were all our Blessed Father's servants virtuous (he would not have suffered any who were not, to form part of his household), but, following their master's example, they were all singularly gentle and obliging in their manners and behaviour.

*Note from the site editor:* The chapter cuts off here at the end of this page. This was probably a mistake by the printer, since the next page does not skip a number.
