> Chap. II.—_That the great goodness and charity of God is shewed to man in this sacrament._
> 
> The Voice of the Disciple.
> 
> O Lord, trusting in thy goodness and in thy great mercy, I come sick to my Saviour, hungry and thirsty to the Fountain of Life, needy to the King of Heaven, a servant to his Lord, a creature to his Creator, and one in desolation to his loving Comforter.
> 
> But whence is this to me, that thou shouldst come to me? Who am I, that thou shouldst give me thyself?
> 
> How dare such a sinner appear before thee? and how dost thou vouchsafe to come to a sinner?
> 
> Thou knowest thy servant, and thou knowest that he has nothing of good in him which can entitle him to this favour.
> 
> I confess therefore my unworthiness, I acknowledge thy bounty, I praise ihy goodness, and I give thee thanks for thy excessive charity:
> 
> For it is for thy own sake thou doest this, not for my merits, that thy goodness may be better known to me; that greater charity may he imparted, and humility more perfectly recommended.
> 
> Since therefore this is what pleaseth thee, and thou hast commanded it should be so, thy merciful condescension pleaseth me also; and I wish that my iniquity may be no obstacle.
