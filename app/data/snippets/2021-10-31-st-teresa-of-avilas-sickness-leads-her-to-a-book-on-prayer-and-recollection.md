> The change in the habits of my life, and in my food, proved hurtful to my health; and though my happiness was great, that was not enough. The fainting-fits began to be more frequent, and my heart was so seriously affected that every one who saw it was alarmed; and I had also many other ailments.
>
> And thus it was I spent the first year, having very bad health, though I do not think I offended God in it much. And as my illness was so serious---I was almost insensible at all times, and frequently wholly so---my father took great pains to find some relief; and as the physicians who attended me had none to give, he had me taken to a place which had a great reputation for the cure of other infirmities. They said I should find relief there.
>
> That friend of whom I have spoken as being in the house went with me. She was one of the elder nuns. In the house where I was a nun, there was no vow of enclosure.
>
> I remained there nearly a year, for three months of it suffering most cruel tortures---effects of the violent remedies which they applied. I know not how I endured them; and indeed, though I submitted myself to them, they were, as I shall relate, more than my constitution could bear.
>
> I was to begin the treatment in the spring, and went thither when winter commenced. The intervening time I spent with my sister, of whom I spoke before, in her house in the country, waiting for the month of April, which was drawing near, that I might not have to go and return.
>
> The uncle of whom I have made mention before, and whose house was on our road, gave me a book called *Tercer Abecedario,* which treats of the prayer of recollection. Though in the first year I had read good books---for I would read no others, because I understood now the harm they had done me---I did not know how to make my prayer, nor how to recollect myself. I was therefore much pleased with the book, and resolved to follow the way of prayer it described with all my might.
>
> And as our Lord had already bestowed upon me the gift of tears, and I found pleasure in reading, I began to spend a certain time in solitude, to go frequently to confession, and make a beginning of that way of prayer, with this book for my guide; for I had no master---I mean, no confessor who understood me, though I sought for such a one for twenty years afterwards: which did me much harm, in that I frequently went backwards, and might have been utterly lost; for, anyhow, a director would have helped me to escape the risks I ran of sinning against God.
