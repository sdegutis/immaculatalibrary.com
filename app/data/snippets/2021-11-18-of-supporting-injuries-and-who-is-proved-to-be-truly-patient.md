> 1\. What is it thou sayest, my Son? Cease to complain, considering my passion, and that of other saints:
>
> Thou hast not yet resisted unto blood:
>
> What thou sufferedst is but little, in comparison of them who have suffered so much; who have been so strongly tempted, so grievously afflicted, so many ways tried and exercised.
>
> Thou must then call to mind the heavy sufferings of others, that thou mayest the easier bear the little things thou sufferest.
>
> And if to thee they seemed not little, take heed lest this also proceed from thy impatience.
>
> But whether they be little or great, strive to bear them all with patience.
>
> 2\. The better thou disposest thyself to sufferings, the more wisely dost thou act, and the more dost thou merit; and thou wilt bear it more easily, thy mind being well prepared for it, and accustomed to it.
>
> Do not say, I cannot take these things from such a man, and things of this kind are not to be suffered by me, for he has done me a great injury, and he upbraids me with things I never thought on; but I will suffer willingly from another, and as far as I shall judge fitting for me to suffer.
