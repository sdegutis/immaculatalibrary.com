> ### *Practical Resolution.*
>
> O my God! how good and merciful Thou art. Seeing that Thou hast promised to hear and help me when I pray to Thee, and also knowing that my Blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ has promised that His Eternal Father will grant me everything I ask in His holy name, I resolve, first, by the grace of God, to have the greatest faith and confidence in holy prayer; and, secondly, in all my wants, in all my temptations and dangers, to beg help and grace of the Eternal Father, through the name and merits of His Divine Son, Jesus Christ.
>
> Eternal Father, through the name and merits of Jesus, grant me the grace to keep all my good and holy resolutions.
>
> ### *Prayers.*
>
> O my good and merciful God, hear me and help me in my poor prayers.
>
> Eternal Father, through the name and merits of Thy Beloved Son, Jesus, my Blessed Lord and Saviour, save me from sin, and from the dangerous occasions of sin.
>
> Grant me purity of intention to do all my actions. Grant me the grace to walk ever in the presence of God.
>
> When my head and hands are at work, may my heart watch, and praise and bless God by holy and constant aspirations.
>
> Father! through the name and merits of Jesus, Thy Divine Son, grant me the spirit of prayer, the love and practice of humility and self denial, and zeal for the salvation of souls.
>
> St. Joseph, so exalted in the spirit of prayer, obtain for me faith and confidence in the power and efficacy of prayer.
>
> "Soul of Jesus, sanctify me. Body of Jesus, save me. Blood of Jesus, inebriate me. Water flowing from the side of Jesus, wash me. Passion of Jesus, strengthen me. O good Jesus, hear me. Hide me in Thy wounds. Permit not that I should be separated from Thee. Defend me from the malignant enemy. Call me at the hour of my death, and bid me come to Thee, that with Thy Saints I may praise Thee for all eternity. Amen."
>

merits of Jesus, the grace to conquer your predominant passion.
>
> ### *Aspiration.*
