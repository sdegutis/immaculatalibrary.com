> CHAPTER II.
>
> *Considerations on the favour which God does us in calling us to his service, according to the protestation indicated in the first part.*
>
> Consider the points of your protestation:
>
> 1. First, to have forsaken, cast away, detested, and renounced for ever all mortal sin.
>
> 2. Secondly, to have dedicated and consecrated your soul, heart, and body, with all their powers and faculties, to the love and service of God.
>
> 3. Thirdly, that if you should chance to fall into any sin, you would immediately rise again by the help of God's grace.
>
> Are not these just, noble, and generous resolutions? Consider well in your soul, therefore, how holy and reasonable this protestation is, and how much it is to be desired.
