> Nothing that the infinite power, wisdom, and love of God could do, in a sense, were wanting to sanctify, purify, and beautify the soul of Mary in honour of the Incarnation; hence perfect sinlessness, perfect purity, perfect immaculateness, perfect union with and love of God, were her unique privileges at her Conception and during her whole life. The Almighty was pleased, if we may so speak, with the work of His hands, and no doubt, watched over Mary with a jealous care.
>
> To whose care was this heavenly jewel, this Lily of Israel, committed? To St. Joseph's.
>
> To whose guardianship was the Immaculate Virgin entrusted? To St. Joseph's.
>
> From the highest heavens God surveyed the earth from pole to pole to find one worthy of Mary; and whom did He find? St. Joseph.
>
> Long before the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin, God had created a soul for a high and holy mission; and for that mission God showered upon the soul the choicest dewdrops of heavenly graces. Who was he? St. Joseph.
>
> Who, among the sons of men, was found, worthy to receive at the altar the hand of the Virgin Mother of God in consecrated wedlock? St. Joseph.
>
> Who was the angel, in human flesh, that a jealous God appointed to guard, in marriage, the perpetual vow of chastity that Mary had made from her cradle? St. Joseph.
>
> Under whose roof did the Eternal Word become Incarnate? St. Joseph's.
>
> Whose faith never wavered, never doubted the fidelity of his spouse? St. Joseph's.
>
> Whose hands were privileged to earn daily bread for the support of the Mother of the God of the universe? St. Joseph's.
>
> On whose arm did Mary, in her delicate state, lean for support from Nazareth to Bethlehem? St. Joseph's.
>
> Who watched over Mary at the crib at Bethlehem? St. Joseph.
>
> Who helped Mary on the Flight into Egypt? Who died in the arms of the Mother of God? St. Joseph.
>
> Here we have one reason, one cause, one source, of the dignity; and hence of the sanctity, and special virtues, and privileges of St. Joseph. The relation of a spouse, a guardian, a protector for the Virgin Mother of God, the Immaculate Queen of heaven, speaks more eloquently than words for the holiness of our great St. Joseph.
>
> We know that God loved Mary so tenderly, and in honour of the Incarnation of the Eternal Word, watched over, with such jealous care, her unique privileges, that He would give her for her protector no other than the purest, the most immaculate, and the most holy of the sons of men.
