> *Practical Resolution.*
>
> To do the will of God is Christian perfection. To be resigned in all things to God's holy will, to take all things from God's holy hands, converts dull earth into a paradise. Our days in this vale of tears are full of sorrows; but resignation to God's holy will sweetens all the bitterness of life.
>
> In pain, therefore, in trials, in disappointments, in evil as in good fortune, in sickness and in death, I resolve, by the aid of Divine grace, to be resigned to God's holy will; to take all things from God's divine hands, and to say, with holy Job, "The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away: as it hath pleased the Lord, so be it done: blessed be the name of the Lord."
>
> *Prayer.*
>
> "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven."
>
> "Teach me to do Thy will, for Thou art my God."
>
> "For what have I in heaven? and, besides Thee, what do I desire upon earth? For Thee my flesh and my heart have fainted away! Thou art the God of my heart, and the God that is my portion for ever" (Ps. lxxii. 25).
>
> "May the most just, the most high, the most amiable will of God be done, praised, and eternally exalted in all things."
>
> "To Thee, O merciful God, I confess that often, under trials and disappointments, I have murmured and repined against Thy adorable will. In Thy divine mercy, O Lord, forgive the past, and, for the future, grant me the grace to be resigned in all things to Thy holy will. In trials, in pains, in evil as in good things, in sickness and in death, may I ever say, 'Thy will be done;' 'as it hath pleased the Lord, so it is done: blessed be the name of the Lord.'"
>
> *Practice.*
>
> To-day make several fervent acts of conformity to the holy will of God; and, after each act, beg of God the grace, in all future trials, to be resigned to the holy will of Providence.
>
> *Aspiration.*
>
> "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven." "The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away: as it hath pleased the Lord, so it is done: blessed be the name of the Lord."
