> Charity alone can place us in perfection, but obedience, chastity, and poverty, are the three principal means by which to attain to it. 
>
>â€‹Obedience consecrates our heart, chastity our body, and poverty our means to the love and service of God.
>
> These three branches of the spiritual cross are grounded on a fourth, viz., humility.
>
> I shall say nothing of these three virtues, when they are solemnly vowed, because this subject concerns religious orders only; nor even when they are simply vowed; for though a vow may add many graces and merits to virtues, yet, to make us perfect, it is not necessary that vows should be made, provided they be observed.
>
> For though being vowed, and especially solemnly, they place a man in the state of perfection; yet, to arrive at perfection itself, they must be observed, there being a very great difference between the state of perfection and perfection itself; since all bishops and religious are in a state of perfection; and yet, alas, all have not arrived at perfection itself, as is too plainly to be seen.
>
> Let us endeavour then, Philothea, to practise well these virtues, each one according to his vocation; for though they do not place us in the state of perfection, yet they will make us perfect: and, indeed, everyone is obliged to practise them, though not all after the same manner.
