> An Act of Consecration to St. Joseph
>
> Glorious St. Joseph! worthy amongst all the Saints to be venerated, loved, and invoked, because of the excellence of thy virtues, the eminence of thy glory, and the power of thy intercession; in the presence of the most Adorable Trinity, of Jesus thy adopted Son, and of Mary thy chaste spouse, and my tender Mother, I take thee this day as my advocate, my protector, and father. I firmly resolve never to forget thee, and to love and honour thee all the days of my life, and to do all that I can to spread devotion to thee among the faithful.
>
> Deign to protect me in a special manner, O my beloved father. I am unworthy, it is true; yet, in the name of the love thou bearest for Jesus and Mary, receive me among the number of thy special friends.
>
> In the name of this double society, which was formed beside thee by Jesus and Mary, during thy whole life, protect me as long as I live, so that I may never be separated from God by sin. In the name of thy happy death, in the arms of Jesus and Mary, protect me, especially at the hour of my death; so that dying, accompanied by thee, by Jesus, and by Mary, I may come to thank thee in heaven, and in thy holy company praise, bless, glorify, and enjoy God for all eternity. Amen.
