> But why did not Mary confide in Joseph, for hitherto he had been the depositary of all her thoughts?
>
> First, because the secret which the angel had revealed to her she understood to have been intended for herself alone, wherefore she would not communicate it even to Joseph, fearing to go beyond the Divine will.
>
> Moreover, the Virgin was possessed of much discretion and forethought. If she made known to him that the Son of God had become incarnate within her, she knew, indeed, that he would believe her, but she knew also his humility and reverent spirit, and may have thought that, awed by so much majesty, he would perhaps retire and leave her.
>
> She waited therefore until the mystery should be divinely manifested to him; and, finally, being herself perfect mistress of humility, she dared not utter any word which would turn to her own praise.
>
> And so Mary kept silence; she knew that it is "good to hide the secret of the King," but she knew also that it is "honourable to reveal and confess the works of God".
>
> Accordingly, while concealing the mystery that had been accomplished in her, to wit, the Incarnation of the Divine Word, she acquainted her beloved spouse with the prodigy which God had wrought in their cousin Elizabeth, and with her desire to go and congratulate her on the favour which had been shown her.
