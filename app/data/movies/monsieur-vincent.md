### Overview

Biopic of St. Vincent de Paul, of how he founded the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, and his motivations and reflections.

### Review

Very good and inspiring. Seems very accurate.

### Caveats

A few brief scenes of gore near the middle may be too much for young children. Some mature themes. In French.
