### Overview

Excellent and very faithful retelling of the story of St. Bernadette's vision of the Blessed Virgin at Lourdes.

### Review

Much more faithful to the actual events than the earlier movie "Song of Bernadette". Shows her persecutions very well.

### Caveats

Generally very family friendly.
