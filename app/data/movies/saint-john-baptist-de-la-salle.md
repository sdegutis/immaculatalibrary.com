**Overview**: Later life of St. John Baptist de la Salle, starting with his founding of schools, through the end of his life, showing his difficulties and persecutions.

**Review**: The movie was generally inspiring and enjoyable.

**Caveats**: It's generally very family friendly, except for one scene with a few men hanging from trees as the saint begins traveling on a road near the end of the movie. Also, I cannot yet attest to the accuracy of it, since I know very little about his actual life.
