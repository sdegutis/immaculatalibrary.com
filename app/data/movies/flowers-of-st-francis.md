### Overview

Brief glimpses into the life and spirit of St. Francis of Assisi and the first Franciscans.

### Review

Very good and inspiring. Can't attest to literal accuracy, but seems to capture the spirit of the Saint.

### Caveats

Few scenes of violence that may be too much for very young children, such as an almost-execution of Juniper and the audible harming of an animal. In Italian.
