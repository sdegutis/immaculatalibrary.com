### Overview

A very well made movie that tells the basic story of St. Don Bosco and his compassion for the abandoned youth of Turin, Italy.

### Review

Shows his courage and virtues, some of his persecutions, some miracles of God's Divine Providence, and mentions his dreams. Overall very well done.

### Caveats

Very family friendly, but with some rough language near the middle, and some splashing in a river that goes on too long.
