### Overview

Beautifully made film about St. Brother Albert, who gave up a promising career in art in order to personally serve and live among the poor and homeless.

### Review

Based on a play by St. John Paul II, which he called rather an "inner theater" than a drama, the dialogue is richly theological and philosophical. The filmmakers did a wonderful job adapting this to film, calling it not a film but a filmed play.

### Caveats

Most of the dialogue will go well over the heads of young children, and an amputation scene at about 7 minutes in, which lasts about a minute, is probably unsuitable for anyone.
