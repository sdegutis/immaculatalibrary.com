### Overview

Movie about the more notable aspects of the life of St. Padre Pio. Seems to be accurate, from what we can find in our books and online about this saint.

### Review

Interesting and inspiring movie.

### Caveats

A few scenes might be inappropriate for children younger than teenagers. Padre Pio exorcizes a possessed woman. Shortly afterwards, he's physically attacked by invisible demons. Later, a man admits to a plot to commit murder.
