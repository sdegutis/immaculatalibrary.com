> Softly a light is stealing,
> Sweetly a maiden sings,
> Ever wakeful, ever wistful,
> Watching faithfully, thankfully,
> Tenderly her King of kings.
> 
> My soul doth magnify,
> Doth magnify the Lord:
> And my spirit hath rejoiced,
> Rejoiced in God my Saviour.
> 
> Mary her song to Jesus
> Softly serenely sings:
> “I will love you, I will serve you,
> May my lullaby glorify,
> Magnify my King of kings”.
> 
> Lullaby, lullaby.
