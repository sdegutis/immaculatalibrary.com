### Online Mass

If God valued Mass and the Eucharist so much that he miraculously allowed St. Clare of Assisi to remotely participate in Mass on her wall while she was too sick to go, then surely God sees some value in it! And I do believe he will bless us for participating remotely.

Here's a list of [Online Virtual Masses](https://mass-online.org/daily-holy-mass-live-online/) in real-time.

### Online Adoration

Adoration is one of the most literal, physical ways of being near Jesus, since in the Blessed Sacrament, He is truly and really present. So many Saints have strongly recommended this practice, such as St. Alphonsus de Liguori and St. Peter Julian Eymard.

If God blesses online Mass, it seems reasonable that he would also appreciate our remote Adoration.

Below is a YouTube livestream of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament:

If that one is down, here's an alterative [Online Adoration](https://www.youtube.com/embed/live_stream?channel=UCTv8s3mfmdIIXNcw_5Pdv_w&autoplay=1).
