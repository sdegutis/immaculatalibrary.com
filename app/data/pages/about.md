The website Immaculata Library began as a quick place to store digital copies of invaluable and timeless Catholic books that have become copyright free, in order to easily share them with friends and family.

Over time, it has grown to be a full online library, with links to free and paid Sacred music, links and reviews of Catholic movies, and links to other resources to help Catholics grow in devotion in this digital age.

Only the most useful and approved of all Catholic books are selected for this website. This means, only books that have received official approbations from Bishops, *and* have helped to produce Saints, or are written by Saints, are offered.
