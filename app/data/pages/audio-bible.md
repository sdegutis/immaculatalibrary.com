The **Truth and Life Dramatized Audio New Testament** is an incredible 22-hour performance of the entire New Testament. You can get the [mobile app](https://www.truthandlifeapp.com/) or the [18-disc CD set](https://www.truthandlifeapp.com/audio.html). They also offer the [Gospel of Mark](https://www.truthandlifeapp.com/WebBibleTAL/WebPlayer.aspx) for free, so you can even sample it now on the web.

If you are serious about taking your devotion to God to the next level, this audiobook is practically a must-have. Listen to it in the car, in the shower, while you fall asleep, while you clean, or any time you want! Incredible acting, realistic sound effects, and an amazing score, all work together to truly bring the RSVCE translation to life.

***Tip:*** If you purchase the CDs, you can put them on any digital device (such as an iPhone), and have access to the whole audio bible for the rest of your life.
