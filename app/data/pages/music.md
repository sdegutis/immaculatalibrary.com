Reading holy books can help us grow in devotion to God, and movies can help us visualize these sacred mysteries. But countless angels are singing the Lord's praises *right now* in Heaven. Listening to Sacred Music (and singing or playing it!) is a powerful way to join these angels in praising our Lord and Redeemer, in a way that deeply touches the Father's heart.

### Free Links to Sacred Music

Here is some of the most beautiful music I've ever heard. Possibly the closest thing on earth to hearing the angels sing. They're all sung by the amazing choir of [National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception](https://www.nationalshrine.org/).
