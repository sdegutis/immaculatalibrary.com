From the preface: "[Fr. Cochem] devoted himself, in addition to his pastoral duties, to the writing of pious books in a popular style. â€¦ His best and most popular work was the 'Life and Sufferings of Our Lord Jesus Christ and His Mother Mary,' of which this volume is an abridgment and rearrangement."
