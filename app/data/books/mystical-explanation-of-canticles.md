An explanation of the Song of Songs by a saint, the bride being the Church Militant (or the soul). From this version "This book treats of the way to arrive at a perfect form of mental prayer".

Also includes testimony from St. Frances de Chantal, under oath, about the life and virtues of St. Francis de Sales during his canonization process.

**Note**: This book actually is two books in one. The deposition actually starts on page 42 (in the book's own numbering).
