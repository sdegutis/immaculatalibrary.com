title: How can a loving god allow eternal suffering?
---

This is one of the most common questions I encounter when debating non Christians of every kind. Why did God create Hell, or at least allow for it to be created? It just doesn't seem fair to most minds. Eternity seems a disproportionately long time to suffer for anything we could do wrong in this life.

Before I give a very reasonable answer, I should point out that we don't actually have to fully understand it. We just have to conclude that some answer might be plausible. The Church received the teaching of Hell from the Apostles, so it's an objective reality, whether any individual agrees with it or fully understands it.

But I think there is a reasonable answer, and it's been unearthed by recent psychologists and the many atrocities of the past few hundred years.

First, the core teaching of the Church says *very little* about Hell. All we know for certain is that it never ends, you can never leave it, and it involves suffering. That's pretty much it.

Different theologians and philosophers have tried to answer this by focusing on the justice of the suffering and the eternity of it. They say God is infinitely good, so our sins deserve an infinite punishment, either in intensity or duration. I never really found this reasoning very convincing. All it did was lead me to the plausibility of Hell.

My theory is that God doesn't actually cause us suffering, we cause it to ourselves and each other, directly and indirectly.

First, consider that Jesus is the eternal Word of God. The original Greek word for "Word" here could also be translated "Reason" or "Logic". This has many theological implications, but the one relevant here is that we are designed for logical consistency.

Modern psychology has revealed through an abundance of data that a significant source of our suffering comes from our own flawed reasoning. Most, if not all, of our self-inflicted problems come from internal logical contradictions: we want to have our cake and eat it too.

This is one of the effects of sin: we prefer a lie to the truth, though we still want to live in reality. We just want the consequences of our actions to be different. We want to separate doing something bad from something bad happening.

Now imagine God suddenly separated everyone into two camps: those who want to do things the right way (but who struggle to do so), and those who want to do things the wrong way and have only good things come from it.

Imagine he instantaeously transforms the nature of the first group, so that they no longer have to struggle against doing things the wrong way. They're instantly capable of doing everything correctly and properly, and there's absolutely nothing resisting this process anymore. This is the group that becomes "Heaven".

But imagine he tried to do this to the second group. They wouldn't want it! They *want* to do things the wrong way, they just don't want the logical consequences to follow. So this "power" to do things correctly or right (maybe "righteousness?") is useless to them. They reject it. This second group is called "Hell".

So what happens in Heaven? Finally life operates the way we all instictually know it ought to: things go well, everything is good, everyone is happy, life is beautiful and good, and we all celebrate together, and we finally *live life to the fullest*. And it lasts forever.

God wants this for everyone, for those in the group called Heaven and for those in the group called Hell. Those in Hell want it too, but they want logic to work on their own terms, rather than them working on logic's own terms.

But what happens to this group called "Hell"? They finally get to have the life they want, and have it in abundance: a life of brokenness, a life of incorrectness, of logical fallacies, of confusion, of trying to reconcile truth with deception, reality with illusion. Of trying to reconcile what is and what's not.

More concretely: every sin they love so much, they'll finally be able to do without limit.
