> 1\. I Bless thee, O Heavenly Father, Father of my Lord Jesus Christ; because thou hast vouchsafed to be mindful of so poor a wretch as I am.
>
> O Father of mercies, and God of all comfort, I give thanks to thee, who sometimes art pleased to cherish with thy consolations, me that am unworthy of any comfort.
>
> I bless thee and glorify thee evermore, together with thy only begotten Son, and the Holy Ghost the Comforter, to all eternity.
>
> O Lord God, my holy lover, when thou shalt come into my heart, all that is within me will be filled with joy.
>
> Thou art my glory, and the joy of my heart:
>
> Thou art my hope and my refuge in the day of my tribulation.
