> O my God! if I might, I would speak of the occasions from which God delivered me, and how I threw myself into them again; and of the risks I ran of losing utterly my good name, from which He delivered me.
>
> I did things to show what I was; and our Lord hid the evil, and revealed some little virtue---if so be I had any---and made it great in the eyes of all, so that they always held me in much honour.
>
> For although my follies came occasionally into light, people would not believe it when they saw other things, which they thought good. The reason is, that He Who knoweth all things saw it was necessary it should be so, in order that I might have some credit given me by those to whom in after-years I was to speak of His service.
>
> His supreme munificence regarded not my great sins, but rather the desires I frequently had to please Him, and the pain I felt because I had not the strength to bring those desires to good effect!
>
> O Lord of my soul! how shall I be able to magnify the graces which Thou, in those years, didst bestow upon me? Oh how, at the very time that I offended Thee most.
>
> Thou didst prepare me in a moment, by a most profound compunction, to taste of the sweetness of Thy consolations and mercies! In truth, O my King, Thou didst administer to me the most delicate and painful chastisement it was possible for me to bear; for Thou knewest well what would have given me the most pain. Thou didst chastise my sins with great consolations. I do not believe I am saying foolish things, though it may well be that I am beside myself whenever I call to mind my ingratitude and my wickedness.
>
> It was more painful for me, in the state I was in, to receive graces, when I had fallen into grievous faults, than it would have been to receive chastisement; for one of those faults I am sure used to bring me low, shame and distress me, more than many diseases, together with many heavy trials, could have done.
>
> For, as to the latter, I saw that I deserved them; and it seemed to me that by them I was making some reparation for my sins, though it was but slight, for my sins are so many.
>
> But when I see myself receive graces anew, after being so ungrateful for those already received, that is to me---and, I believe, to all who have any knowledge or love of God---a fearful kind of torment.
>
> We may see how true this is by considering what a virtuous mind must be. Hence my tears and vexation when I reflected on what I felt, seeing myself in a condition to fall at every moment, though my resolutions and desires then---I am speaking of that time---were strong.
>
> It is a great evil for a soul to be alone in the midst of such great dangers; it seems to me that if I had had any one with whom I could have spoken of all this, it might have helped me not to fall. I might, at least, have been ashamed before him---and yet I was not ashamed before God.
>
> For this reason I would advise those who give themselves to prayer, particularly at first, to form friendships and converse familiarly with others who are doing the same thing.
>
> It is a matter of the last importance, even if it lead only to helping one another by prayer: how much more, seeing that it has led to much greater gain!
>
> Now, if in their intercourse one with another, and in the indulgence of human affections even not of the best kind, men seek friends with whom they may refresh themselves, and for the purpose of having greater satisfaction in speaking of their empty joys, I know no reason why it should not be lawful for him who is beginning to love and serve God in earnest to confide to another his joys and sorrows; for they who are given to prayer are thoroughly accustomed to both.
