> O truly happy spouse! Adam rejoiced when he received from God Eve for a companion, but his joy was soon turned into sorrow, for Eve brought to him irreparable woe; while Joseph's joy in receiving Mary for his companion was constant and enduring, for Mary was to him the cause of endless felicity. Mary brought him everlasting riches as her dowry, so that he might truly say, "All good things came to me together with her, and innumerable riches through her hands". [Wisdom vii. 11.]

> Now, if the Virgin is wont to obtain such great graces even for sinners, enemies of her Son, how many favours must she not have obtained for her holy spouse, the guardian of her purity and the loving foster-father of her Divine Son! And if we, miserable creatures, often profit greatly from consorting and conversing with holy men, who are as nothing compared to the Virgin, how much may we not suppose Joseph to have profited by his association and conversation with the Queen of all Saints!

> "Mary," says Gerson, "for so many years inspired and communicated graces to Joseph by her looks, by her voice, by her example, by her conversation;" and again Cartagena: "What a vast increase of spiritual joy and virtue must we not esteem Joseph to have received from the society of the Blessed Virgin, from having been worthy of hearing so often the sweet voice of the Mother of God, contemplating her heavenly countenance, and enjoying, not only her blessed presence, but even her conjugal affection and intimacy!"
