> Moreover, the divine Son, as we know, came into the world to redeem Mary before all others, as we read in St. Bernardine of Sienna.\* And as there are two modes of redeeming, as St. Augustine teaches, one by raising the fallen; the other, by preventing from failing;\* doubtless, the latter is the most noble.
>
> More nobly, says St. Antoninus, is he redeemed who is prevented from falling, than he who is raised after failing;\* because in this way is avoided the injury or stain that the soul always contracts by a fall.
>
> Therefore we ought to believe that Mary was redeemed in the nobler manner, as became the mother of a God, as St. Bonaventure expresses it; for Frassen proves the sermon on the assumption to have been written by that holy doctor.\*
>
> We must believe that by a new mode of sanctification the Holy Spirit redeemed her at the first moment of her conception, and preserved her by a special grace from original sin, which was not in her, but would have been in her.\*
>
> On this subject Cardinal Cusano has elegantly written: Others have had a deliverer, but the holy Virgin had a predeliverer;\* others have had a Redeemer to deliver them from sin already contracted, but the holy Virgin had a Redeemer who, because he was her Son, prevented her from contracting sin.
