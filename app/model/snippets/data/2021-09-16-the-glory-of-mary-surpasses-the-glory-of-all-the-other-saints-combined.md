> The graces of the saints were different in each, as St. Paul said: "There are diversities of graces." So that each of them corresponding with the grace received, has rendered himself excellent in some virtue; one in saving souls, one in leading a life of penance, one in suffering torments, one in contemplation; hence the holy Church, when celebrating their festivals, says of each: "And there was not found the like to him."
>
> And as in their merits, so are they in heaven different in glory: "for star differeth from star in glory." The Apostles differ from the martyrs, confessors from virgins, the innocents from penitents.
>
> The holy Virgin being full of all graces, excelled each saint in every kind of virtue; she was the apostle of the apostles; she was queen of the martyrs, for she suffered more than all of them; she was the standard-bearer of the virgins, the model of spouses; she united in herself a perfect innocence with a perfect mortification; in a word, she united in her heart all the most heroic virtues which any saint has ever practised.
>
> Hence it was said of her: "The queen stood on thy right hand in gilded clothing, surrounded with variety;" for all the graces, privileges, and merits of the other saints were found united in Mary, as the Abbot of Celles says: "The prerogatives of all the saints, oh Virgin, thou hast united in thyself."
>
> Thus as the splendor of the sun exceeds the splendor of all stars united, so, says St. Basil, the glory of the divine mother exceeds that of all the blessed.
