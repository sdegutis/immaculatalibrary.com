> 5\. Give me, O Lord, heavenly wisdom, that I may learn above all things to seek thee, and to find thee; above all things to relish thee, and to love thee, and to understand all other thhigs, as they are, according to the order of thy wisdom.
>
> Grant that I may prudently decline him that flatters me, and patiently bear with him that contradicts me.
>
> For this is great wisdom, not to be moved with every wind of words, nor to give ear to the wicked flattering Siren; for thus shall we go on securely in the way we have begun.
