> CHAPTER VII.
>
> LUKEWARMNESS. THE LOSS OF GRACE. INCONVENIENCE OF LAXITY IN RELIGIOUS HOUSES.
>
> *Of the way whereby she lost the graces God had granted her, and the wretched life she began to lead; she also speaks of the danger arising from the want of a strict enclosure in convents of nuns.*
>
> So, then, going on from pastime to pastime, from vanity to vanity, from one occasion of sin to another, I began to expose myself exceedingly to the very greatest dangers: my soul was so distracted by many vanities that I was ashamed to draw near unto God in an act of such special friendship as that of prayer.
>
> As my sins multiplied, I began to lose the pleasure and comfort I had in virtuous things: and that loss contributed to the abandonment of prayer. I see now most clearly, my Lord, that this comfort departed from me because I had departed from Thee.
>
> It was the most fearful delusion into which Satan could plunge me---to give up prayer under the pretence of humility. I began to be afraid of giving myself to prayer, because I saw myself so lost. I thought it would be better for me, seeing that in my wickedness I was one of the most wicked, to live like the multitude---to say the prayers which I was bound to say, and that vocally; not to practise mental prayer nor commune with God so much; for I deserved to be with the devils, and was deceiving those who were about me, because I made an outward show of goodness.
>
> And therefore the community in which I dwelt is not to be blamed, for with my cunning I so managed matters, that all had a good opinion of me; and yet I did not seek this deliberately by simulating devotion, for in all that relates to hypocrisy and ostentation---glory be to God!---I do not remember that I ever offended Him, so far as I know. The very first movements herein gave me such pain, that the devil would depart from me with loss, and the gain remained with me; and thus, accordingly, he never tempted me much in this way. Perhaps, however, if God had permitted Satan to tempt me as sharply herein as he tempted me in other things, I should have fallen also into this; but His Majesty has preserved me until now. May He be blessed for evermore!
>
> It was rather a heavy affliction to me that I should be thought so well of; for I knew my own secret.
>
> The reason why they thought I was not so wicked was this: they saw that I, who was so young and exposed to so many occasions of sin, withdrew myself so often into solitude for prayer, read much, spoke of God, that I liked to have His image painted in many places, to have an oratory of my own, and furnish it with objects of devotion, that I spoke ill of no one, and other things of the same kind in me which have the appearance of virtue. Yet all the while---I was so vain---I knew how to procure respect for myself by doing those things which in the world are usually regarded with respect.
>
> In consequence of this, they gave me as much liberty as they did to the oldest nuns, and even more, and had great confidence in me; for as to taking any liberty for myself, or doing anything without leave---such as conversing through the door, or in secret, or by night---I do not think I could have brought myself to speak with anybody in the monastery in that way, and I never did it; for our Lord held me back. It seemed to me---for I considered many things carefully and of set purpose---that it would be a very evil deed on my part, wicked as I was, to risk the credit of so many nuns, who were all good---as if everything else I did was well done! In truth, the evil I did was not the result of deliberation, as this would have been, if I had done it, although it was too much so.
