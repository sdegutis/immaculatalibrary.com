>
> Mary! of all creation the noblest, highest, purest, fairest, holiest work of God! O that all men knew thee, and loved thee, my queen! as thou deservest to be loved!
>
> Yet great is my consolation, Mary! that so many blessed souls in heaven, and so many just souls still on earth, are filled with love for thy beauty and goodness. But above all I rejoice in this, that God himself loves thee alone more than all men and angels.
>
> I too, loveliest queen! I a miserable sinner dare to love thee, mean though my love be. I would I had greater love, more tender love: this thou must gain for me, since to love thee is the surest mark of predestination, and a grace which God vouchsafes to the elect.
>
> Then, too, my Mother! when I reflect upon the debt I owe thy Son, I see that his love for me demands in return an immeasurable love. Do thou, who desirest nothing else than to see him loved, pray that I may obtain this grace---a great love of Jesus Christ. Obtain it, thou who obtainest from God what thou wilt. Not goods of earth, nor honor, nor riches do I covet, but that which thine own heart desires most---to love my God alone. Oh can it be that thou wilt not aid me in a desire so acceptable to thee! Impossible! even now I feel thy help, even now thou prayest for me.
>
> Pray Mary! pray; and never cease to pray, till thou dost see me safe in paradise, sure of possessing and loving my God and thee, my dearest Mother! for ever and ever. Amen.
>
> *Three Hail Marys.*
