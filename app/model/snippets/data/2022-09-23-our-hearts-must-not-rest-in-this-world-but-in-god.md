> 4\. Why dost thou stand looking about thee here, since this is not thy resting place?
>
> Thy dwelling must be in heaven: and all things of the earth are only to be looked upon as passing by.
>
> All things pass away, and thou along with them.
>
> See that thou cleave not to them, lest thou be ensnared and lost.
>
> Let thy thought be with the Most High, and thy prayer directed to Christ without intermission.
>
> If thou knowest not how to meditate on high and heavenly things, rest on the passion of Christ, and willingly dwell in his secret wounds.
>
> For if thou fly devoutly to the wounds and precious stigmas of Jesus, thou shalt feel great comfort in tribulation; neither wilt thou much regard the being despised by men, but wilt easily bear up against detracting tongues.
