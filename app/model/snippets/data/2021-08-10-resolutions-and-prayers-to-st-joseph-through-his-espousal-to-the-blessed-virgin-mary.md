> ### *Practical Resolution*
>
> Jesus is God. Jesus is infinitely holy, infinitely sacred, infinitely wise, infinitely powerful, and worthy of the supreme homage, adoration, and love of men and Angels for all eternity.
>
> Next to Jesus, but of course infinitely inferior in dignity and sanctity, is Mary His Mother. Mary Immaculate Mother of God is the holiest soul ever created by the hands of the Almighty.
>
> The next noblest and holiest soul that issued from the breath of God to animate the slime of the earth is that of Joseph. St. Joseph is next to Mary, yet unspeakably beneath her, in dignity, sanctity, and glory.
>
> When I adore Jesus and pay my loving and Blessed Saviour supreme homage and worship, I resolve always to invoke the aid and intercession of Mary and Joseph.
>
> ### *Prayers*
>
> Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, I offer to you my heart and soul.
>
> Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, assist me in my last agony.
>
> Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, may I breathe forth my soul in peace with you.
>
> "Foster-father, Joseph, our guide, protect us and our holy Church."
>
> "Guardian of virgins and holy Father Joseph, to whose faithful custody Jesus Christ, Innocence itself, and Mary, Virgin of virgins, were committed, I pray and beseech thee, by these dear pledges, Jesus and Mary, that being preserved from all uncleanness, I may, with a spotless mind, pure heart, and chaste body, serve Jesus and Mary all the days of my life."
>
> "God who in Thine ineffable Providence didst vouchsafe to choose Blessed Joseph to be the husband of Thy most holy Mother, grant, we beseech Thee, that we may be made worthy to receive him for our intercessor in heaven, whom on earth we venerate as our holy Protector, who livest and reignest world without end. Amen."
>
> ### *Practice*
>
> Today several times on bended knees pray to St. Joseph to ask and request his holy spouse the Blessed Virgin to adopt you as her child.
>
> ### *Aspiration*
>
> O Blessed Virgin Mary my holy mother and St. Joseph my protector, obtain for me the grace to love and serve Jesus faithfully all the days of my life.
