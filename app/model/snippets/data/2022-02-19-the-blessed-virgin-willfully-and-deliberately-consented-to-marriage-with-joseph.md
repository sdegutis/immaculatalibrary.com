> We have said that this marriage, having been decreed in Heaven, was also to receive the highest earthly sanction in the decision of the heads of the Jewish Church. It wanted now the consent of Mary, and consent is essential in the contract of matrimony.
>
> The Blessed Virgin, as has been observed, was certain to submit to the will of God in all that concerned her, but this must not lead us to think of her submission as simply blind and passive. It was a free consent, a reasonable consent.
>
> Even when an archangel was sent from Heaven to announce to her the Incarnation of the Word, we find her first pondering anxiously the meaning of Gabriel's salutation, and even asking a question for the removal of a difficulty and the satisfaction of her mind: "How shall this thing be?" before pronouncing the *Fiat mihi*.
>
> If, then, as is most true, she gave her consent to her espousals with Joseph, we may be sure that it was not without mature deliberation and examination of the obligations which she was about to assume.
