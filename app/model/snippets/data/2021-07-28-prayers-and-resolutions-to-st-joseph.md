> *Resolutions.*
>
> In imitation of St. Joseph, I resolve, by the aid of Divine grace, first, to obey promptly all the calls and secret inspirations of Almighty God.
>
> Secondly, in order to sanctify my dally occupations, I resolve to offer to God's greater glory each and every act of the day, in union with the life and death of Jesus; in union with all the Masses daily offered up to Heaven throughout Christendom; and in union with Jesus in all the tabernacles in the Catholic Church.
>
> Thirdly, I resolve every day to beg of God the grace of a happy death; like St. Joseph, to die in the peace and love of Jesus and Mary.
>
> O merciful God, through the name, love, and merits of Jesus, grant me the grace to keep these resolutions.
>
> St. Joseph, obtain for me the grace to lead a holy life and die a happy death.
>
> *A Prayer to obtain the grace of a Happy Death.*
>
> O Lord Jesus Christ, by the bitterness Thou wast pleased to suffer on the Cross for love of me, especially when Thy sacred soul departed from Thy body, have mercy upon my poor soul, now and at the hour of my death, that I may be admitted to the immediate vision and possession of Thee for all eternity. Amen.
>
> *A Prayer to St. Joseph to obtain the grace of a Holy Life and Happy Death.*
>
> O great St. Joseph, obtain for me from Jesus the grace to keep all God's commandments, and to promptly obey the secret calls and inspirations of Heaven. St. Joseph, obtain for me the grace to do all my actions to please God alone. O St. Joseph, ask of Jesus, for me, the grace never to commit a mortal sin. O my dear St. Joseph, watch over me during life, be with me at death, and obtain for me Paradise. St. Joseph, spouse of Mary, beg of the Blessed Virgin to obtain for me, from Jesus her Son, the grace to lead a holy life and die a happy death. Amen.
>
> *A Prayer to St. Joseph for the grace of a Happy Death.*
>
> O glorious St. Joseph, the model, the patron, and the comforter of the dying, I now beg thy protection at the last moment of my life; obtain, I beseech thee, that I may die the death of the just.
