> CHAPTER IX.
> 
> THE MEANS WHEREBY OUR LORD QUICKENED HER SOUL, GAVE HER LIGHT IN HER DARKNESS, AND MADE HER STRONG IN GOODNESS.
> 
> *By what means God began to rouse her soul and give light in the midst of darkness, and to strengthen her virtues so that she should not offend Him.*
> 
> My soul was now grown weary; and the miserable habits it had contracted would not suffer it to rest, though it was desirous of doing so.
> 
> It came to pass one day, when I went into the oratory, that I saw a statue which they had put by there, and which had been procured for a certain feast observed in the house.
> 
> It was a representation of Christ most grievously wounded; and so devotional, that the very sight of it, when I saw it, moved me---so well did it show forth that which He suffered for us.
> 
> So keenly did I feel the evil return I had made for those wounds, that I thought my heart was breaking. I threw myself on the ground beside it, my tears flowing plenteously, and implored Him to strengthen me once for all, so that I might never offend Him anymore.
> 
> I had a very great devotion to the glorious Magdalene, and very frequently used to think of her conversion---especially when I went to Communion. As I knew for certain that our Lord was then within me, I used to place myself at His feet, thinking that my tears would not be despised. I did not know what I was saying; only He did great things for me, in that He was pleased I should shed those tears, seeing that I so soon forgot that impression. I used to recommend myself to that glorious Saint, that she might obtain my pardon.
> 
> But this last time, before that picture of which I am speaking, I seem to have made greater progress; for I was now very distrustful to myself, placing all my confidence in God.
> 
> It seems to me that I said to Him then that I would not rise up till He granted my petition. I do certainly believe that this was of great service to me, because I have grown better ever since.
