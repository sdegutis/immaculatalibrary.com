> I remember that, when my mother died, I was about twelve years old a little less. When I began to understand my loss, I went in my affliction to an image of our Lady, and with many tears implored her to be my mother. I did this in my simplicity, and I believe that it was of service to me; for I have by experience found the royal Virgin help me whenever I recommended myself to her; and at last she has brought me back to herself.

> It distresses me now, when I think of, and reflect on, that which kept me from being earnest in the good desires with which I began.
>
> O my Lord, since Thou art determined to save me---may it be the pleasure of Thy Majesty to effect it!---and to bestow upon me so many graces, why has it not been Thy pleasure also---not for my advantage, but for Thy greater honour---that this habitation, wherein Thou hast continually to dwell, should not have contracted so much defilement?
>
> It distresses me even to say this, O my Lord, because I know the fault is all my own, seeing that Thou hast left nothing undone to make me, even from my youth, wholly Thine.
>
> When I would complain of my parents, I cannot do it; for I saw nothing in them but all good, and carefulness for my welfare.
>
> Then, growing up, I began to discover the natural gifts which our Lord had given me---they were said to be many; and, when I should have given Him thanks for them, I made use of every one of them, as I shall now explain, to offend Him.
