> Let us now consider how the Saviour really did come from heaven to meet his mother, and at the first interview said, to console her; "Arise, make haste, my love, my dove, my beautiful one, and come; for winter is now past ... and gone."
>
> Come, my dear mother, my beautiful and pure dove, leave that valley of tears where thou hast suffered so much for my love; come from Libanus, my spouse, come from Libanus, come, thou shalt be crowned.
>
> Come with soul and body, to enjoy the reward of thy holy life. If thou hast suffered much upon earth, far greater is the glory that I have prepared for thee in heaven.
>
> Come there to sit near me; come to receive the crown that I will give thee as queen of the universe.
>
> Now, behold, Mary leaves the earth, and calling to mind the many graces she had there received from her Lord, she looks at it at the same time both with affection and compassion, leaving in it so many poor children, in the midst of so many miseries and dangers.
>
> And now Jesus offers her his hand, and the blessed mother rises in the air and passes beyond the clouds and spheres.
>
> Behold her now arrived at the gates of heaven.
>
> When monarchs made their entrance to take possession of their kingdom, they do not pass through the gates of the city, for either these are taken off entirely, or they pass over them.
>
> Hence the angels, when Jesus Christ entered paradise, cried: "Lift up your gates, O ye princes, and be ye lifted up, O eternal gates; and the King of glory shall enter in."
>
> Thus, also, now that Mary is going to take possession of the kingdom of the heavens, the angels who accompany her cry to the others who are within: "Lift up your gates, ye princes, and be ye lifted up, O eternal gates, and the queen of glory shall enter in."
>
> And now Mary enters into the blessed country. But on her entrance, the celestial spirits seeing her so beautiful and glorious, ask of those who are without, as Origen describes it, and exclaim, all rejoicing in heaven in one (voice): "Who is this that cometh up from the desert, flowing with delights, leaning upon her beloved?"
>
> And who is this creature so beautiful, that comes from the desert of the earth, a place so full of thorns and tribulation?
>
> But this one comes so pure and so rich in virtue, supported by her beloved Lord, who deigns to accompany her with so great honor. Who is she?
>
> The angels who accompany her answer: This is the mother of our King, she is our queen, and the blessed one among women, full of grace, the saint of saints, the beloved of God, the immaculate, the dove, the most beautiful of all creatures.
>
> And then all those blessed spirits begin to bless and praise her, singing, with more reason than the Hebrews said to Judith: "Thou art the glory of Jerusalem, thou art the joy of Israel, them art the honor of our people."
>
> Ah! our Lady and our queen, then thou art the glory of paradise, the joy of our country, thou art the honor of us all; be ever welcome, be ever blessed; behold thy kingdom, behold us, we are all thy servants, ready for thy commands.
