> CHAPTER III.
>
> *Invocation, the second point of the Preparation.*
>
> Being sensible that you are in the presence of God, prostrate yourself with the most profound reverence, acknowledging yourself unworthy to appear before so sovereign a Majesty; yet, knowing that his goodness so wills it, humbly beg the grace to serve and worship Him in this meditation.
>
> To this end you may use these short and inflamed words of David: "Cast me not, O God, away from thy face, and take not thy holy spirit from me. Make thy face to shine upon thy servant, and I will consider the wondrous things of thy law. Give me understanding, and I will search out thy law, and I will keep it with all my heart. I am thy servant; give me understanding." (Ps. cxvii.)
>
> It would also be advisable to invoke your guardian angel, as well as the saints who had some part in the mysteries on which you meditate; as, for example, in meditating on the death of our Lord, you may invoke our Blessed Lady, St. John, St. Mary Magdalen, and other saints, begging that the inward affections and emotions which they at that time conceived, may be communicated to you.
>
> Also, in meditating on your own death, you may invoke your good angel, who will then be present with you, beseeching him to inspire you with proper considerations; and so of other mysteries.
