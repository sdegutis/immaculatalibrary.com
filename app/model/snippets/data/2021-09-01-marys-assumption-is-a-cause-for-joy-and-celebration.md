> It would seem just that the holy Church, on this day of the Assumption of Mary to heaven, should rather invite us to weep than to rejoice, since our sweet mother has quitted this earth, and left us bereft of her sweet presence, as St. Bernard says: It seems that we should rather weep than exult.
>
> But no, the holy Church invites us to rejoice: "Let us all rejoice in the Lord, celebrating a festival in honor of the blessed Virgin Mary." And justly, if we love this our mother, we ought to congratulate ourselves more upon her glory than upon our own particular consolation. What son does not rejoice, although separated from his mother, if he knows that she is going to take possession of a kingdom?
>
> Mary, to-day, is to be crowned queen of heaven, and shall we not make a feast and rejoice if we truly love her? "Let us all rejoice, let us rejoice."
>
> And that we may be consoled the more by her exaltation, let us consider, in the first place, how glorious was the triumph of Mary ascending to heaven; secondly, how exalted was the throne to which she was elevated in heaven.
