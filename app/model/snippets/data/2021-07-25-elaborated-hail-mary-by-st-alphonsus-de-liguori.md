> Oh immaculate and holy Virgin! oh creature the most humble and the greatest before God! thou wast so small in thy own eyes, but so great in the eyes of thy Lord, that he exalted thee even to choose thee for his mother, and therefore to make thee queen of heaven and of earth.
>
> I then thank that God who hath so much exalted thee, and rejoice with thee in seeing thee so closely united to God, that more is not permitted to a pure creature.
>
> I am ashamed to appear before thee who art so humble, with so many graces; I, a miserable sinner, and so proud with so many sins.
>
> But wretched as I am, I, too, wish to salute thee:
>
> *Hail Mary, full of grace.* Thou art already full of grace; obtain a share of it also for me.
>
> *The Lord is with thee.* The Lord who hath ever been with thee even from the first moment of thy creation, is now more intimately with thee, by making himself thy Son.
>
> *Blessed art thou among women.* Oh woman, blessed among all women, obtain for us also the divine benediction.
>
> *And blessed is the fruit of thy womb.* Oh blessed plant which hath given to the world a fruit so noble and so holy.
>
> *Holy Mary, mother of God.* Oh Mary, I confess that thou art the true mother of God, and for this truth I would give my life a thousand times.
>
> *Pray for us sinners.* But if thou art the mother of God, thou art also the mother of our salvation, and of us poor sinners; since it is to save sinners that God made himself man; and he has made thee his mother that thy prayers may have the power to save every sinner. Pray for us, oh Mary.
>
> *Now and in the hour of our death.* Pray always; pray now, while we are in life, in the midst of so many temptations and so great danger of losing God; but still more, pray in the hour of our death, when we are on the point of leaving this world and being presented at the divine tribunal; that being saved by the merits of Jesus Christ, and by thy intercession, we may one day come, without the danger of losing thee any more, to salute thee and praise thee, with thy Son, in heaven, for all eternity.
>
> Amen.
