> A desire to spend more time with Him began to grow within me, and also to withdraw from the occasions of sin: for as soon as I had done so, I turned lovingly to His Majesty at once.
> 
> I understood clearly, as I thought, that I loved Him; but I did not understand, as I ought to have understood it, wherein the true love of God consists.
> 
> I do not think I had yet perfectly disposed myself to seek His service when His Majesty turned towards me with His consolations.
> 
> What others strive after with great labour, our Lord seems to have looked out for a way to make me willing to accept---that is, in these later years to give me joy and comfort.
> 
> But as for asking our Lord to give me either these things or sweetness in devotion, I never dared to do it; the only thing I prayed Him to give me was the grace never to offend Him; together with the forgiveness of my great sins.
> 
> When I saw that my sins were so great, I never ventured deliberately to ask for consolation or for sweetness. He had compassion enough upon me, I think---and, in truth, He dealt with me according to His great mercy---when He allowed me to stand before Him, and when He drew me into His presence; for I saw that, if He had not drawn me, I should not have come at all.
> 
> Once only in my life do I remember asking for consolation, being at the time in great aridities. When I considered what I had done, I was so confounded, that the very distress I suffered from seeing how little humility I had, brought me that which I had been so bold as to ask for.
> 
> I knew well that it was lawful to pray for it; but it seemed to me that it is lawful only for those who are in good dispositions, who have sought with all their might to attain to true devotion---that is, not to offend God, and to be disposed and resolved for all goodness.
> 
> I looked upon those tears of mine as womanish and weak, seeing that I did not obtain my desires by them; nevertheless, I believe that they did me some service; for, specially after those two occasions of great compunction and sorrow of heart, accompanied by tears, of which I am speaking, I began in an especial way to give myself more to prayer, and to occupy myself less with those things which did me harm---though I did not give them up altogether. But God Himself, as I have just said, came to my aid, and helped me to turn away from them.
> 
> As His Majesty was only waiting for some preparation on my part, the spiritual graces grew in me as I shall now explain.
> 
> It is not the custom of our Lord to give these graces to any but to those who keep their consciences in greater pureness.
