> *August 29*

> Grace is a supernatural dress and ornament for the soul, made by the hands of the Holy Ghost, which renders her so acceptable to God that He adopts her for His daughter, and takes her for His bride.
>
> It is in this dress the prophet gloried, when he said: "I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, and my soul shall be joyful in my God: for He hath clothed me with the garment of salvation; and with the robe of justice He hath covered me, as a bridgeroom decked with a crown, and as a bride adorned with jewels"; which are the several gifts of the Holy Ghost, wherewith the soul of a just man is adorned and beautified by the hand of God.
>
> One of the greatest is, to make her look so lovely and fair in the eyes of God, that He chooses her, as has been said, for His daughter, His spouse, His temple and His habitation, where He takes His pleasure with the children of men.
