> *Practical Resolution.*
>
> My good God! from the above reflection I clearly understand how powerful is the intercession of St. Joseph, and all that my great Saint can and will do for my salvation.
>
> In my spiritual wants and in my temptation I neglected to "go to Joseph." My Divine Saviour, I know Thou wilt not refuse the requests of St. Joseph, who loved Thee so tenderly on earth, who saved Thy very life, and supplied Thy wants and comforts.
>
> I resolve, therefore, frequently and fervently to invoke the aid and prayers of St. Joseph to save me from sin, to help me in temptations, and to obtain for me the grace of a holy life and happy death.
>
> Secondly, when I want a special favour, I resolve to go straight to St. Joseph and ask it of him, and to keep asking till I get it.
>
> *Prayer.*
>
> O my father, patron, and generous dispenser of everlasting riches, it is to thee I address my humble prayers for thy aid and protection. If God Himself says to me: "Go to Joseph," it is because He has placed special graces in thy hands to dispense them to me. It is in thy powerful hands, O St. Joseph, I place my life and salvation. Be thou my support and my aid for the rest of my days. May my last words be, "Jesus, Mary, and Joseph."
>
> O holy father, St. Joseph, whose power is so great with Jesus, pray for me; adopt me as thy child; watch over my salvation; help me when I am tempted; keep me in God's holy fear and love; be with me dying; and never abandon me until thou seest me safe in Paradise.
>
> Jesus, my Blessed Saviour, grant me faith and confidence in the power and prayers of St. Joseph.
>
> *Practice.*
>
> To-day, on bended knees, before an altar or statue of St. Joseph, firmly resolve, every day of thy life, to beg the prayers of St. Joseph for the grace of a holy life and a happy death.
>
> *Aspiration.*
>
> O my great St. Joseph! pray for me when I am tempted to sin; pray for me to avoid the occasions of sin, and obtain for me a happy death and favourable judgment.
