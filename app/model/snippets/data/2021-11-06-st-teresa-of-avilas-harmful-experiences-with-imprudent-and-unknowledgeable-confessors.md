> In the place to which I had gone for my cure lived a priest of good birth and understanding, with some learning, but not much.
>
> I went to confession to him, for I was always fond of learned men, although confessors indifferently learned did my soul much harm; for I did not always find confessors whose learning was as good as I could wish it was.
>
> I know by experience that it is better, if the confessors are good men and of holy lives, that they should have no learning at all, than a little; for such confessors never trust themselves without consulting those who are learned---nor would I trust them myself: and a really learned confessor never deceived me.
>
> Neither did the others willingly deceive me, only they knew no better; I thought they were learned, and that I was not under any other obligation than that of believing them, as their instructions to me were lax, and left me more at liberty---for if they had been strict with me, I am so wicked, I should have sought for others.
>
> That which was a venial sin, they told me was no sin at all; of that which was most grievously mortal, they said it was venial.
>
> This did me so much harm, that it is no wonder I should speak of it here as a warning to others, that they may avoid an evil so great; for I see clearly that in the eyes of God I was without excuse, that the things I did being in themselves not good, this should have been enough to keep me from them.
>
> I believe that God, by reason of my sins, allowed those confessors to deceive themselves and to deceive me. I myself deceived many others by saying to them what had been said to me.
>
> I continued in this blindness, I believe, more than seventeen years, till a most learned Dominican Father [F. Vicente Baron.] undeceived me in part, and those of the Company of Jesus made me altogether so afraid, by insisting on the erroneousness of these principles, as I shall hereafter show. [See ch. xxiii.]
