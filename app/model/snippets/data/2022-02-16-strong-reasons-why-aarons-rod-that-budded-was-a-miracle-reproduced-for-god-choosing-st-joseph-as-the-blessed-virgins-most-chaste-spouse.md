> It is true that critics are not wanting who reject these traditions altogether, gathered, as they allow, from very ancient legendary writings, but writings which are apocryphal, that is, unauthentic and doubtful.
>
> But is this sweeping condemnation of all that is found contained in such writings reasonable? Hardly so. We have here to deal with a pious tradition, not gathered merely from these apocryphal sources, but handed down among the faithful.

> It has been alluded to by saints and doctors, and adopted by devout and diligent historians of St. Joseph in later times. Moreover, from the earliest ages of the Church it has been depicted on tablets and sculptured in marble.

> Many, indeed, have seen therein the literal fulfilment in symbol of that prophecy of Isaias: "And there shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall rise up out of his root". [Isaias xi. 1.]

If these books offer no guarantee of the truth of any particular affirmation contained in them, neither, on the other hand, is everything they relate to be necessarily condemned as false.
