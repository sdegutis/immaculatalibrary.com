> Another accounts himself devout if he recites daily a multiplicity of prayers, though he immediately afterwards utters the most disagreeable, arrogant, and injurious words amongst his domestics and neighbours.
>

> These are esteemed devout, when, in reality, they are by no means so.

> As Saul's servants sought David in his house, Michol laid a statue in his bed, and covering it with David's clothes, made them believe it was David himself; so many persons, by covering themselves with certain external actions belonging to devotion, make the world believe that they are truly devout, whereas they are actually nothing but statues and phantoms of devotion.
