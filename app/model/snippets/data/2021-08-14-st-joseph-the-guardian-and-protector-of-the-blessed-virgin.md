> *St. Joseph the Guardian and Protector of the Blessed Virgin.*

> "An Angel of the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph saying: Arise, take the child and his mother and fly into Egypt. ... Who arose and took the child and his mother by night and returned into Egypt and remained there until the death of Herod. ... But when Herod was dead, behold an Angel of the Lord appeared in sleep to Joseph in Egypt, saying, arise and take the child and his mother and go into the land of Israel. Who arose and took the child and his mother and came into the land of Israel" (Matt. ii. 13-20).

> Meditate on the sublime mission of St. Joseph. Mary was nearer and dearer to God than any creature that ever existed. Mary wanted a guardian worthy of herself, and God chose from among the children of men St. Joseph for this holy mission. After the Incarnation with what reverence did St. Joseph regard Our Blessed Lady.

> Reflect on his unique privileges. During the long and fatiguing journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem, with what reverence and love did St. Joseph minister to Mary's wants and comforts. When fatigued, how often the Virgin Mother used to lean upon his arm for support, and recline her head upon the chaste bosom of her spouse to seek repose.

> At the whisper of an Angel the Holy Family fled into Egypt. St. Joseph's loving care lightened Mary's fatigues during the journey. The cedar of the forest, as well as the fruit trees of the desert, recognising the Lord of creation, bowed down in homage, and St. Joseph plucked fruits and flowers for Mary and Jesus.

> During the stay in Egypt on the return home to Judea, and during his life at Nazareth, St. Joseph was the guardian protector of the Blessed Virgin, and with a loving hand supplied all her wants and comforts. What privilege could be higher, holier, or more sublime!

> Meditate what lights, what graces, what sanctity did St. Joseph receive from God by his constant and holy conversation with the Blessed Virgin on heavenly subjects.
>
> The moon reflects upon dull earth her cheerful, refreshing light shed upon her by the sun; so the Blessed Virgin, the mystic moon, reflected upon the soul of St. Joseph the choicest gifts and graces, shed upon her own soul by Jesus Christ the Eternal Sun of Justice.

> If cold hearts are warmed, and tepid souls made fervent, as they have been, by the society and conversation of holy souls; how estimable the heavenly joys, the sublime graces, the choicest gifts showered upon the soul of St. Joseph, by the grace of God, from his heavenly communing with the Blessed Virgin on divine truths.
>
> St. Joseph may say of his holy spouse, "When I go into my house I shall repose myself with her, for her conversation hath no bitterness, nor her company any tediousness, but joy and gladness" (Wisd. viii. 16).

> A celebrated French author, writing on this subject, says:---"When we meditate upon these things it is difficult to find words to express even inadequately the wonder and astonishment that we feel at this sublime vocation of Joseph, to whom God has confided the richest treasures of heaven and earth."
