> ### *Practical Resolution.*
>
> My good God, I know that prayer is the key of heaven.
>
> Prayer sheds the light and grace of God upon the soul. Prayer is the salt of the earth, the dew of heaven upon the soul.
>
> Without prayer I cannot overcome myself, the world, and the devil. Without prayer I cannot be saved.
>
> I resolve every day of my life, and often during the day, to beg of God, through the bowels of His divine mercy, and through the name and merits of Jesus, my Blessed Saviour, to grant me the spirit of prayer.
>
> ### *Prayer.*
>
> O Eternal Father, through the bowels of Thy divine mercy and through the merits and holy name of Jesus Thy Divine Son, enlighten me on the necessity of prayer, and grant me the spirit of prayer.
>
> O God of mercy, wash away all my past sins in the Precious Blood of Jesus. I am sorry I ever offended so good a God. O Jesus, help me for the future; save me from sin; help me when tempted; grant me the grace to call upon Thee, O Jesus, in the hour of need.
>
> I beseech Thee, O God, to take me out of life rather than permit me to commit one mortal sin. O Mary and Joseph, obtain for me from Jesus the spirit of prayer.
>
> "Divine Mercy, incarnate in the Sacred Heart of Jesus, inundate the world and diffuse Thyself upon us." "May the most just, the most high, and the most amiable will of God be done, praised, and eternally exalted in all things."
>
> ### *Practice.*
>
> To-day several times renew your morning offering.
>
> ### *Aspiration.*
>
> My God! I offer to Thee my heart with its affections, my soul with its faculties, and my body with its senses, in union with the life and Death of Jesus.
