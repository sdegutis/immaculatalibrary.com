>
> O my most holy Mother! on the one hand I see the graces which thou hast obtained for me; and on the other, the ingratitude I have shown thee. The ungrateful are unworthy of all favors; yet not for this will I distrust thy mercy.
>
> Great advocate, have pity on me! Thou Mary! dost bestow every grace which God vouchsafes to us sinners, and, therefore, did he make thee mighty, rich and kind that so thou mightest succor us.
>
> I wish to save my soul. In thy hands I place my eternal welfare; to thee I intrust my soul. I wish to be of those who are thy especial servants: cast me not, then, away.
>
> Thou art seeking the wretched to console them. Do not abandon a wretched sinner, who has recourse to thee. Speak for me, Mary! thy Son grants what thou askest. Take me under thy protection, and it is enough, because with thee to guard me, I fear no ill. No, not my sins, because thou wilt obtain God's pardon for them: nor the devils, because thou art far mightier than hell; nor my judge, Jesus Christ, for at thy prayer, he will lay aside his wrath.
>
> Protect me, then, my Mother! obtain for me pardon of my sins, love for Jesus, holy perseverance, a good death, and paradise. It is true, I merit not these graces; yet do thou only ask them of our God, and lo! they shall be mine. Pray, then, to Jesus for me. Mary, my queen! in thee I trust; in this trust I rest, I live; in this trust I hope to die. Amen.
