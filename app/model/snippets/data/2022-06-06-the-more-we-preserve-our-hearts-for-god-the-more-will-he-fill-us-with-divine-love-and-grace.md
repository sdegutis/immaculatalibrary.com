> But he that attributes any thing of good to himself, stops the grace of God from coming into him; for the grace of the Holy Ghost ever seeks an humble heart.
> 
> If thou couldst perfectly annihilate thyself, and cast outfrom thyself all created love, then should I flow into thee with abundance of grace.
> 
> When thou lookest towards creatures, the sight of the Creator is withdrawn from thee.
> 
> Learn for the Creator's sake, to overcome thyself in all things; and then thou shalt be able to attain to the knowledge of God.
> 
> How little soever it be, if a thing be inordinately loved and regarded, it keeps us back from the Sovereign Good, and conupts the soul.
