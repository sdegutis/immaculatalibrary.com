> #### *For Holy Perseverance.*
>
> Most holy Mary, queen of heaven! I who was once the slave of Satan, now dedicate myself to thy service forever. I offer myself to honor and to serve thee while I live. Accept me as thy willing servant and cast me not from thee as I deserve.
>
> Mother! in thee have I placed all my hope. All blessing and thanksgiving be to God, who, in his mercy, giveth me this trust in thee.
>
> True it is that in the past I was miserably fallen in sin. But through the merits of Jesus Christ, and by thy prayers, I hope God has pardoned me my sins.
>
> Yet it is not enough, my Mother! to be forgiven, whilst the thought appals me that I may still lose the grace of God. Danger is ever nigh, the devil sleeps not, fresh temptations assail me.
>
> Protect me, then, my sovereign mistress! help me against the assaults of hell. O never, never, let me sin again, and offend Jesus thy Son. No never, never more suffer me to risk my soul, heaven, and my God, by sin. For this one grace I ask thee, Mary! this I desire; this may thy prayers obtain for me. Such is my hope. Amen.
