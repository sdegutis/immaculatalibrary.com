Goodness and truth are inseparable.
Jesus came into the world bringing both truth and grace.
Jesus said only a good and honest heart brings forth abundant fruit.
St. Paul said those who love sin choose delusion over truth.
Hebrews says an evil and unbelieving heart are the same thing.
Adam and Eve rejected both God's truth and God's morals.
To love the truth is to do what is good.

Winter seems to be a metaphor given to us by God to describe eternal Hell.
There's no color, the sky and the ground are both a dull gray.
There's no warmth, the sun has no effect despite its presence.
There's no life, all the useful animals are hidden and asleep.
There's no food, all the plants are barren and fruitless.
There's no music, all the birds of the air have moved away.
There's no hope, the only way out is if the sun gets closer again.

God's will is for you to good and avoid sin.
To find God's will, look for where you can do good and avoid sin.
If you can do good, then you can be confident God is helping you.
If you fall into sin despite prayers, you wandered from God's protection.
Don't worry about mixing up God's will with Satan's will accidentally.
Just as pagans demand a sacrifice of you every now and then, so does Satan.
If you're trying to do God's will and can resist temptations, you're safe.

Desire for physical pleasure is never satisfied, it can only be abandoned.
Food, alcohol, drugs, bad music, these never quench our thirst but increase it.
When we don't think we have real food, we at least settle for unfilling crumbs.
Physical goods decrease when used, spiritual pleasures increase when used.
Good music, love, friendship, creativity, these never run out, but multiply.
