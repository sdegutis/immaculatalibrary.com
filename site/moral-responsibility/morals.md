Goodness and truth are inseparable.
Jesus came into the world bringing both truth and grace.
Jesus said only a good and honest heart brings forth abundant fruit.
St. Paul said those who love sin choose delusion over truth.
Hebrews says an evil and unbelieving heart are the same thing.
Adam and Eve rejected both God's truth and God's morals.
To love the truth is to do what is good.

Winter seems to be a metaphor given to us by God to describe eternal Hell.
There's no color, the sky and the ground are both a dull gray.
There's no warmth, the sun has no effect despite its presence.
There's no life, all the useful animals are hidden and asleep.
There's no food, all the plants are barren and fruitless.
There's no music, all the birds of the air have moved away.
There's no hope, the only way out is if the sun gets closer again.

God's will is for you to good and avoid sin.
To find God's will, look for where you can do good and avoid sin.
If you can do good, then you can be confident God is helping you.
If you fall into sin despite prayers, you wandered from God's protection.
Don't worry about mixing up God's will with Satan's will accidentally.
Just as pagans demand a sacrifice of you every now and then, so does Satan.
If you're trying to do God's will and can resist temptations, you're safe.

You can never make yourself happy, only being loved can make you happy.
Love comes from God and from God alone, for God *is* love.
God loves us all, and we are happier the more we recognize his love.
When others truly love us, it's God's love passing through them to us.
We can make others happy by doing something out of true love for them.
Recognize God's love for you, and love others freely and without worry.
Those in heaven are always loving and happy, those in hell never are either.

"Look what you have done to yourself."
An abusive and wicked person says this to their victims after abusing them.
They want their victim to believe it's the victim's fault for being abused.
But we are responsible for our own actions, we cannot blame others for it.
If we do wrong and blame someone else's actions for it, we are not excused.
If someone blames us for the wrong they did to us, they are not with God.
But God is not mocked, and he will have his vengeance against such in due time.

Desire for physical pleasure is never satisfied, it can only be abandoned.
Food, alcohol, drugs, bad music, these never quench our thirst but increase it.
When we don't think we have real food, we at least settle for unfilling crumbs.
Physical goods decrease when used, spiritual pleasures increase when used.
Good music, love, friendship, creativity, these never run out, but multiply.
