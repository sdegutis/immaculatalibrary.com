Desire for physical pleasure is never satisfied, it can only be abandoned.
Food, alcohol, drugs, bad music, these never quench our thirst but increase it.
When we don't think we have real food, we at least settle for unfilling crumbs.
Physical goods decrease when used, spiritual pleasures increase when used.
Good music, love, friendship, creativity, these never run out, but multiply.

Winter seems to be a metaphor given to us by God to describe eternal Hell.
There's no color, the sky and the ground are both a dull gray.
There's no warmth, the sun has no effect despite its presence.
There's no life, all the useful animals are hidden and asleep.
There's no food, all the plants are barren and fruitless.
There's no music, all the birds of the air have moved away.
There's no joy, seasonal depression robs many people of happiness.
There's no hope, the only way out is if the sun gets closer again.

"... then they can change their doctrine and their rules."
Recently Sen. Noel Frame said this about the seal of confession becoming illegal.
This statement shows that she does not believe in absolute, objective truth.
If a doctrine is immutable, then by definition, it can't be changed by any human.
The Catholic Church claims that our doctrines are immutable, including Confession.
This is clearly an attack on the Church disguised as concern for the abused.
Yet the abused includes unborn humans murdered with permission from Democrats.
