sudoku bible

ocd is a result of trying to make the results perfect without the right cause

people who reply with "you as well" instead of "you too" are confusing to me
i think they're just trying to imitate what they think sounds smart
its the same with people who refuse to put "for" at the end of a sentence
"what are you here for" is a perfectly valid sentence
a guy who likes latin said you cant do it because latin doesn't allow it
what makes him authoritative? he didn't create english

if a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like a day,
then the thousand years in revelation 20 could just be one 24 hour day.

the bowls of gods wrath dont need to be sequential, they can be concurrent.
the darkness doesn't need to be physical darkness, it could be figurative.

"a man's measure, that is, an angel's" helps explain genesis 6
here, a man means an angel, or rather, a man as holy and pure as an angel.
jesus says resurrected people will be made like the angels in heaven.
jesus in luke says they are equal to angels and are sons of god.
the sons of god doesn't mean literal angels, it means those who do god's will.

when people interpret your words or actions uncharitably against reason,
dont try to defend yourself to them, they're showing you their character.
if you try to justify yourself to them and get their approval,
they will make use of this to get you to bend to their will.
by assuming the worst of you without strong justification,
they are showing you their own red flags, its meant to be a lesson to you.

the world, the kingdom of the dragon, is exactly like the mafia
they will give you peace and security through injustices and these alone
but the moment you reject injustice and accept truth and goodness you're out

everything goes back to the garden of eden
all human decisions and interactions are replaying it
for a man this means he must become like jesus, the new adam
he must do what adam failed to do, which is what jesus did
he must not be caught sleeping but remain awake like in gethsemane
he must stand bold in the face of threats and persecutions and promises
he must not sell out to injustice but stand up for whats genuinely right
he must be completely dependent on no one so that he can be for all people
he must depend solely on god and lead all others to the same sole dependency
he will have to lose everything by standing on principle alone
but he will gain it all back and it will all be far more than worth it

The most useful two functions of the kingdom of the dragon is to produce people and to convince those people that the kingdom of the dragon is corrupt and empty of any possibility of genuine happiness so that they defect to the kingdom of God.

trump no christian virtues tv show humility frowned upon

sleeping cover with blanket like burial cloth

joseph probably crafted beautiful things from salvaged goods

jesus spoke and nobody understood him until he died and rose again
the mass starts with the bible readings and then the crucified jesus
we speak the truth with our life and words, and it influences after death

injustice from people can be used to accomplish gods justice on earth
people can do the right things from gods perspective for evil motives

is a better economy really our hope?
are the rich really better off than the poor?
do they have fewer drug addictions and less crime?
its just different drugs and different crimes
the rich and poor alike all have the same spiritual poverty

diversity of ways and reasons people convert
reflects our inherent diversity

eucharistic miracles

marriage is consent; st paul clearly st Thomas Aquinas st francis de sales

mary had the moon under her feet; we are not sinless

for a while i wondered where are you christ
he seems to say into my imagination im not in pleasure but in pain
there is necessary pain in life, and that is the cross. that's where he is.
when we do what we must do, we find truth, we find jesus, we find god.
and sometimes doing what we must means taking a long overdue punishment.
this is what death is at the end of our lives. this is why it's at the end.

i have no desire or interest in committing suicide, ever, and i never have
i love life, and everything about life, all that's good and beautiful
but most of all i love sharing the beauty and wonder of life with others
theres nothing like showing someone an inspiring movie or beautiful music
the difficulty i have had for a few years is that no one wants me around
but there are other people. one day i will find those with similar interests
only a brood of vipers accused jesus of threatening suicide in the bible

fulton sheen said knowing in marriage is exactly the same as knowing god
to complete the mystical marriage act, the heart must be unlocked from within
completing this act requires trust, ...
in marriage we trust and are vulnerable, then receive pleasure, then pain
with god, we trust and are vulnerable, then receive pain, then pleasure
when we trust that the pain is going to be worthwhile, we are proven right

i have never been able to fully convince myself this life is a good paradise
the few times i was able to convince myself mostly, god reminded me otherwise
when a soldier denies that he's in a battle, he receives many mortal wounds
some people are built to be particularly fierce warriors of god's kingdom
when they deny this war call from god, they fall into the most shameful sins

scientists actually know relatively little about nature
they still dont know why we age, sleep, cant live past 120


laws will be consistent in the next world so we can have predictability

progress
what's the point of progressing? what are we heading towards?
this life is the same, human nature is the same; we're just continuing.
by progress people usually mean moral progress, ie. changing morals.
there is a need to deepen understanding of morals, but without changing it.
it's like getting more digits of pi, more accuracy and precision.
it's not saying wait a minute we were wrong all along, pi starts with 4.
people redefine morals so they can sleep at night with a guilty conscience.
they dont like god's morals but need to convince everyone else to agree.
they hate people who stand up for god's morals and try to discredit them.

sons of god meant those who do god's will.
daughters of men meant those who imitate the mistake of adam and eve.
john explains this in john 8 and interprets gen 6 and job 1.
there were no fallen angels mating with humans, it was mixed moral marriages.
the sons of god in job probably means people offering sacrifices to god.
job probably lived around the time of peleg and lived probably 210 years.

thank god there's a hell.
that's not the same thing as wishing anyone is in hell, or condemning someone.
it's good and natural to hate injustices, especially done against you.
but the problem is we are often poor, partial judges of such injustices.
we are far more lenient toward ourselves and unforgiving with others.
it's not inherently virtuous to hate injustice and sin.
even the demons and damned souls in hell hate the sins of others against them.
but we can be glad there's no sin in heaven, no evildoers, and no evil.
we can be glad that the bad things that happen here don't happen in heaven.
and we can be sure that if someone is in heaven, they have repented of evil.
so we have to hope and pray that those who sin on earth repent before death.
we can never hate others. the moment we hate them, we deserve to be in hell.
wishing someone doesn't go to heaven or goes to hell is the same as hating.
to say we dont want someone in our life is dangerously close to hating them.
how can we be friends with them in heaven if we refuse to be around them here?
countless people say a person should be banished from society for their sins.
they feign that it's for the good of society, and maybe temporarily it is.
but a Christian must believe that jesus can transform a sinner into a saint.
"it's a mortal sin to even suspect a virtuous person of grave sin."
we must find a way to excuse someone's actions, even if they're inexcusable.
often times the good in someone's heart is waiting for a jesus to awaken it.
forgiveness and kindness has nearly miraculous power to transform evil hearts.
if a person is sinning, we don't have to deny the sinfulness.
but we should not judge their soul based on the sins they're committing.
we can't possibly know their heart and their secret thoughts and fears.
everyone is fighting many demons, some more than others. we should HELP them.
and we definitely should not judge people based on sins they did long ago.
judging character is good and important, but must be done justly and truly.
"if someone gets drunk once, we can't call them a drunkard."
if someone does evil, it's no help to them to condemn their actions.
pray for them and be a friend to them.

spirit of levity has taken over the world.

zero dependencies is the goal.
complete freedom to do god's will.
jmj each had this.

do the thing right in front of you. and do it well.
accept all the limitations god placed on you.
limitation breeds creativity.

ear of corn. listening to god is the first step in bearing fruit.

[meh]
the simplest form of government and source of authority:
adam and eve leave the garden. they must work together to survive.
if they split apart, they create two separate societies.
remaining together inherently creates a single society of two persons.
as they remain together, they must make decisions together to survive.
the decisions are going to inherently be restrictive of free will.
each will have to do what they might not want to do in order to survive.
each might need to hunt or build a tent or forage or find shelter.
this necessity is imposed on us by god, and limits our possible actions.
this is the source of law: it is the same as the laws of logic.
if you do this, this will happen, otherwise it won't.

[meh]
people stick out their tongues when teasing.
they stick out their tongues when being goofy, i.e. the sin of levity.
they stick out their tongues when downright sinning in various ways.
the devil is a serpent with a particularly pronounced tongue.
the tongue is called an evil member by st. james in the bible.
the first temptation of humanity was by the tongue of the serpent.
the first sin of humanity was by the tongue of eve eating the fruit.
the first temptation by humans was the tongue of eve speaking to adam.
the first rejection of guilt by humanity was their tongues blaming others.
the tongue isn't inherently evil, but its presence is often indicates evil.
the tongue is used both for tasting and for speaking.
the saints have said that speaking evil of others is a form of cannibalism.
if they disagree on any decision, one of the two decisions has to be taken.
not taking one of the decisions is just making a third decision: delaying.

how many women does it take to change a lightbulb?
none, LED lightbulbs dont need to be changed for about 40 years.

Mary's temptation was like eve's.
would you break your vow?
would you do evil to make good come from it?
the devil's lie is: you can have your cake and eat it too.
you can have pleasure now. there's no need for sacrifice.
you can bring the savior into the world via pleasure, no need to keep a vow.
good things will happen, it's finally the end of your suffering and trials.
this was Mary's temptation as much as eve's. eve failed, mary passed.

someone on social media said we laugh so that we dont cry
this was on a joke video that tried to make the best of a bad situation
this principle is the height of despair
when things are so bad and there seems to be no hope, we try to have fun
this is why the joker has become so popular of a character

thinking is a very real form of interacting with the logos
everyone has access to learn about god by simply reasoning



god promised he would provide food water and clothing being all we need
jesus said your father knows you need food and clothing and will provide it
paul said if we have food and clothing this will be enough
paul admitted he was homeless
jesus was homeless and slept in the mount of olives
we are not guaranteed a house or even a roof over our heads in this life
st francis of assisi and his followers made straw mud stick huts to live in
st benedict joseph labre chose to be homeless for the last decade of his life,
	sleeping on the ground and mostly in the open air,
	never asking for alms, and eating what was given out of charity,
	or eating whatever food he could find in the garbage,
	owning only the clothes on his back rosaries and a few holy books
st benedict chose to live in a cave for three years
st Anthony of the desert chose to live in a tomb for 15 years
the homeless need spiritual help, encouragement, hope
they need someone to live with them without addiction
they need someone to live in the same poverty and help them to love it

francis of assisi rebuilt a church by himself with gifted stones
monks today have lost seemingly all zeal and faith in gods providence
monks used to beg for alms for the poor, now it seems they beg for themselves
monks used to live in hardship and wilderness, now they live in cozy mansions
its true that im thinking of two specific Franciscan monasteries but still

the only useful solution to hardship is to voluntarily take it on
this is true whether homelessness poverty incels ___
take a hardship you're facing, and instead of working against it, own it
this is part of the point of the movie Our God's Brother, another must watch
if you cant afford a home, take this as a sign from god toward another path
live intentionally with less property and seek out god's will within that
if you cant find someone to marry, resolve to be a child of mary and joseph
all god's limitations are guardrails protecting you from many paths to hell
maybe you cant find someone to marry because everyone you might is evil
maybe you cant afford a house because you would end up just like the rich man



randomness entrusted to god is answered inasmuch as its needed and believed in
st francis of assisi opened the bible three times and found his call that way
st francis de sales fell three times and his sword became the cross
the apostles chose by lots Matthias to replace judas
if you make the sign of the cross and open the bible in faith, god teaches you

social media plans are an attempt to prove to ourselves we have power.
if we can collectively get vexbolts to 10m and mass unfollow him,
or if we can collectively agree to not like a user's post and it works,
then we prove to ourselves that collectively we have power.
why stop here? why not use this power to get rid of corruption?

* Modern priests who say certain sinful acts are not sinful and use saints to prove it like JPII or Aquinas
* Theologians who said Teresa of Avila was exaggerating when she said priests said mortal sins were not mortal sins and venial sins were not sins at all
* Priest who told me you can lie under oath and it's not a sin
* Priests who thought John Bosco was genuinely insane and tried to have him locked up just because he trusted God would provide for the needy through him which he always did

* What if Carter OP
* Zelda as playable hero
* Every marvel female hero?
* Star wars witch/heroes

Wikipedia is liberal
Truth is evident to all who love the truth
But those who hate truth and want it to be different are always trying to rewrite truth in books, getting degrees to give themselves credibility to themselves and others, and trying to win debates
There's no such thing as winning debates 


provide value to the world.
keep following your interests.
god gave them to you for a reason.
he can make good use out of hobbies eventually.
i wasted a year or two on TikTok and he helped me make a book out of it.

the kingdom of god and the kingdom of the dragon.
they branch off at adam and jesus.
they both start with patriarchies but dont both end with them.
because the defining feature of the kingdom of god is a united will.
and the kingdom of the dragon is differing wills, discord, disunity.
this is why democracy is inherently more useful in the kingdom of the dragon,
but the kingdom of god is an absolute monarchy with the pope at the head.

please and thank you.
asking permission to do something.
dean withers.

common similarities in character tied to morals.
ties between makeup, abortion, toxic masculinity, true crime drama, etc.

evangelism is all wrong with protties.

priests are the true therapists.
therapy is secular confession.

mary didn't sin.

enoch didn't sin.
its true paul said all sinned.
but paul also said the wages of sin is death.
you cant have both be absolute, since enoch simply didn't die.
people have to choose which one they prefer to take absolutely.
those who prefer to say enoch sinned do so to excuse themselves.
if enoch sinned despite being canonized so gloriously, the bar isn't so high.

Elijah didn't die either so he didn't sin either.
first, people say Elijah sinned because he ran from jezebel.
jesus says when they reject you, flee to another town,
not out of fear but because its useless to waste even one more second there.
they saw the biggest miracle the world ever saw and weren't converted.
so it was useless to remain.
the second sin they accuse him of was asking god to take his life.
he wasn't suicidal and wouldn't have taken his own life.
he was saying god why leave me here where no one good is left to convert.
and god said dont worry theres 7k more good people left,
you still have a mission to fulfill, and he said ok and accepted it.

eucharistic experience. overwhelmed with fear of exploding.

Minecraft is popular because it is a miniature version of creation.
we love to create and organize and beauty the world around us.
we love to create our own worlds with our own logic.
this is why video games in general are popular.
it's why some people love making their own video games. or using mods.

distress for doing evil
doesn't mean god causes it
but that logic itself causes it
and god being logic wont back down or bend to our will
in other words we cant reshape reality to fit our desires
thus it also says peace for those who do good
just like Hebrews says discipline produces peaceful fruit of righteousness

francis of assisi was homeless lived w lepers and built a church by himself
Franciscans today are not built the same anymore
young men need to be more like him again

a government is a body of people
and a leader inherently is the head
in a body there are many members
men are naturally heads and women are naturally hearts
so it makes sense that men will have more grace to lead in general policies
and women will have more grace to lead in compassion-based endeavors
but the nature of compassion is that it must be given personally
for if a person is helped in a cold bureaucratic way they receive no love
but if a person is helped in their needs personally via love they receive love
so policies should not be made on an official level to help the poor and sick
its called hospital because its based on hospitality which must be personal
its called nursing because its naturally a maternal function and desire
women should self organize to help the poor and the sick
and they would be able to afford to if the economy wasn't so corrupt
therefore men should lead in government which should have basic policies
and women should lead in organizing charities to help the sick and poor

the eagle flew at me. almost directly hit me, but went right past.

mel Gibson should have included the words. hes a heretic now.

social media is led by the spirit of the world.
world, devil, flesh = social media, occult, self indulgence

being unprepared for malice causes trauma.
love of god is only way to prevent trauma.
we must recognize that god is good and loves you and will mitigate trauma.
without trust in god's love and goodness and justice and mercy, we suffer.
likewise discipline without love causes trauma but with love doesn't.
the love doesn't even have to be manifest or explicit in the moment.
seeing the crucifixion would traumatize if not for christ's last words.

marys temptation was to break her vow of virginity.
god sent Gabriel with ambiguous words as the temptation,
instead of sending the devil with malicious deceitful words.
the temptation of eve and mary was to live for self or for other.

true crime dramas are red flags.
women aren't sure whether adam or the dragon is evil.
they are inherently much more easily tempted to fear.


someone told me "he could have done anything else but he did this"
i didn't want to say im doing good or the right thing to myself
but the fact that someone else said it gives a little encouragement
if the outcome is that i should become complacent or fruitless its a problem
but if the outcome is that i have more trust that god is helping me
and that he will continue to help me do good and be good
then i will actively cooperate with it and actually try to do the right thing.
this is hope.

How is it not a punishment from God to misspend all your money?

St. Paul says that to love one another sums up the law.
He also says that loving one another fulfills the law.
Most Christians think Jesus fulfilled the law and so we're done.
But we are meant to imitate Christ and be little Christs.
We are meant to repeat his pattern, and do as he did before us.
Most Christians think "believing in Jesus" gets you into heaven.
Heaven is loving one another with the pure and true love of God.
Most Christians Jesus did it all for us so we don't have to do anything.
But Jesus wants us to love one another as he loved us.
We must love one another by laying down our lives for one another.
If we don't do this, then we are deluding ourselves by thinking we know him.
If we don't help our neighbor in real need, Jesus will say I never knew you.


Captain America said "I can do this all day" after he was all out of strength.
Too often being overwhelmed is just us thinking God gave us too many problems.
God promised he would never give us too many problems, and we have to trust that.
The whole point of this life is to learn to not give up and keep trusting God.
The entire purpose of this life requires trying to convince us to not trust God.
The reason "I can do this all day" is so encouraging is because he doesn't give up.
If even a fictional mythological hero can encourage us, why can't the words of Jesus?
And what's the point of making Rogers say that except to convince us we can do the same?
We have to trust that God will not give us more than we can handle.
We have to trust that God always gives us a way to escape every temptation.
The biggest temptation of today is despair, feeling like there's no hope for good.
Despair is giving into the spirit of the world and the devil who tell us to give up.
If we just keep going, fighting for what's right and good, God will not let us down.
God wants good more than we do, and if he wants it to be successful, he will make it so.
He doesn't care so much about the success of our efforts, but that we're not giving up.


What is a prophet? Someone who speaks the word of God to others.
Jesus was the main and final prophet, being the Word of God in the flesh.
Jesus said he is the truth, and he told us the truth about God and about ourselves.
Jesus is the Logos, or reason and logic, and through these we can see the truth.
False prophets call themselves infallible and ridicule anyone who questions them at all.
False prophets call themselves experts and make a living through teaching their lies.
False prophets use logical fallacies to support their lies and hide them in sophistry.

Adam and Eve tried to get knowledge of evil by doing evil.
Jesus and Mary had knowledge of evil without doing evil.
Seeing others do evil and the consequences is far better than doing evil.
Ideally nobody would do evil, and this will happen in heaven.
But apparently, to be convinced not to do evil, we must see the fruits of it.
Maybe this is why God allowed us all to be born into a world full of evil.

Desire for physical pleasure is never satisfied, it can only be abandoned.
Food, alcohol, drugs, bad music, these never quench our thirst but increase it.
When we don't think we have real food, we at least settle for unfilling crumbs.
Physical goods decrease when used, spiritual pleasures increase when used.
Good music, love, friendship, creativity, these never run out, but multiply.

Winter seems to be a metaphor given to us by God to describe eternal Hell.
There's no color, the sky and the ground are both a dull gray.
There's no warmth, the sun has no effect despite its presence.
There's no life, all the useful animals are hidden and asleep.
There's no food, all the plants are barren and fruitless.
There's no music, all the birds of the air have moved away.
There's no joy, seasonal depression robs many people of happiness.
There's no hope, the only way out is when the sun gets closer again.
