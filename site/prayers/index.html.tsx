      <p>Most gracious Virgin Mary, thou who wouldst crush the head of the

        be given so that the demons that influence or seek to influence the members of the
        Auxilium Christianorum do not know the source of their expulsion and blindness.
        Blind them so that they know not our good works. Blind them so that they know
        not on whom to take vengeance. Blind them so that they may receive the just
        sentence for their works. Cover us with the Precious Blood of thy Son so that we
        may enjoy the protection which flows from His Passion and Death. Amen.

      <p>August Queen of the Heavens, heavenly Sovereign of the Angels, Thou who from
        the beginning hast received from God the power and the mission to crush the head

        and tender Mother, Thou wilt always be our love and hope! O Divine Mother, send
        Thy Holy Angels to defend us and to drive far away from us the cruel enemy. Holy
        Angels and Archangels, defend us, guard us. Amen.

        O Glorious Queen of Heaven and Earth, Virgin Most Powerful, thou who hast the
        power to crush the head of the ancient serpent with thy heel, come and exercise this
        power flowing from the grace of thine Immaculate Conception. Shield us under the
        mantle of thy purity and love, draw us into the sweet abode of thy heart and
        annihilate and render impotent the forces bent on destroying us. Come Most
        Sovereign Mistress of the Holy Angels and Mistress of the Most Holy Rosary, thou
        who from the very beginning hast received from God the power and the mission to
        crush the head of Satan. Send forth thy holy legions, we humbly beseech thee, that
        under thy command and by thy power they may pursue the evil spirits, counter them
        on every side, resist their bold attacks and drive them far from us, harming no one
        on the way, binding them to the foot of the Cross to be judged and sentenced by
        Jesus Christ Thy Son and to be disposed of by Him as He wills.
      </p>
      <p>
        St. Joseph, Patron of the Universal Church, come to our aid in this grave
        battle against the forces of darkness, repel the attacks of the devil and free the
        members of the Auxilium Christianorum, and those for whom the priests of the
        Auxilium Christianorum pray, from the strongholds of the enemy.

        St. Michael, summon the entire heavenly court to engage their forces in this

        sword and thrust into hell Satan and all the other evil spirits. O Guardian Angels,
        guide and protect us. Amen.
