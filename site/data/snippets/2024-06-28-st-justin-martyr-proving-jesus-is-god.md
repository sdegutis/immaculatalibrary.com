> “But, my friends,” I continued, “I will produce another testimony from the Scriptures to prove, that as a beginning before all creatures God begot of Himself a certain reasonable Power, which is also called by the Holy Ghost, the Glory of the Lord, at another time a Son, at another Wisdom, at another an Angel, at another God, and at another Lord and Word. He once calls Himself, Captain of the host, when He appeared to Joshua the son of Nun, in the form of man. For He has all these appellations, both from His ministering to the will of the Father, and from His being begotten by will of the Father.

> “But is not this like what we see in ourselves? For when we utter a word we beget it, but not by division, so as to lessen the word that is in us when we utter it; and as we see one fire kindled from another, without that from which it is kindled being diminished, which in fact continues the same, whilst that which is kindled from it does really exist and shine with no diminution of that from which it is kindled.”
