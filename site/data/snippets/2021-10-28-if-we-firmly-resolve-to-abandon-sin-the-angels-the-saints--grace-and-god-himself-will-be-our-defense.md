> Be prepared, therefore, to meet with difficulties. Remember the words of the Wise Man: "Son, when thou comest to the service of God, stand in justice and in fear, and prepare thy soul for temptation." [Ecclus. ii. 1.]
>
> Do not think you are called to enjoyment alone. You must struggle and combat; for, notwithstanding the abundant succor which is offered to us, we must expect hard labor and difficulties in the beginning of our conversion.
>
> That you may not be discouraged, bear in mind that the prize for which you are striving is worth more than all you can ever give to purchase it.
>
> Remember that you have powerful defenders ever near you. Against the assaults of corrupt nature you have God's grace.
>
> Against the snares of the devil you have the almighty power of God.
>
> Against the allurements of evil habits you have the force of good habits confirmed by grace.
>
> Against a multitude of evil spirits you have numberless Angels of light.
>
> Against the bad example and persecutions of the world you have the good example and strengthening exhortations of the Saints.
>
> Against the sinful pleasures and vain joys of the world you have the pure joys and ineffable consolations of the Holy Ghost.
>
> Is it not evident that all that are for you are stronger than all that are against you? Is not God stronger than the devil? Is not grace superior to nature? Are not the good Angels more powerful than the fallen legions of Satan? Are not the pure and ineffable joys of the soul far more delightful than the gross pleasures of sense and the vain amusements of the world?
