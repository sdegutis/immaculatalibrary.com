> Chap. XLIII â€” Against vain and worldly learning.
> 
> 1\. Son, be not moved with the fine and quaint sayings of men; *For the kingdom of God consists not in talk, but in virtue.*
> 
> Attend to my words, which inflame the heart, and enlighten the mind; which excite to compunction, and afford manifold consolations.
> 
> Never read any thing that thou may appear more learned or more wise.
> 
> Study therefore to mortify thy vices, for this will avail thee more than the knowledge of many hard questions.
> 
> 2\. When thou shalt have read, and shalt know many things, thou must always return to one beginning.
> 
> I am he that teacheth man knowledge, and I give a more clear understanding to little ones than can be taught by man.
> 
> He to whom I speak will quickly be wise, and will make great progress in spirit.
> 
> Wo to them that enquire of men after many curious things, and are little curious of the way to serve me.
> 
> The time will come, when Christ, the Master of masters, the Lord of angels, shall appeal, to hear the lessons of all men; that is, to examine the consciences of every one.
> 
> And then he will search Jerusalem with candles, and the hidden things of darkness shall be brought to light, and the arguments of tongues shall be silent.
