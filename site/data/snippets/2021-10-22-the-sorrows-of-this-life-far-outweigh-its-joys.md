> What, then, is human glory but the song of the siren which lures men to destruction, a sweet but poisoned cup, a viper of brilliant colors breathing only venom? It attracts us only to deceive us; it elevates us only to crush us.
>
> Consider, moreover, what a return it exacts for all that it gives.
>
> * Grief at the loss of a child far exceeds the joy of its birth.
> * Loss gives us more pain than profit gives us joy.
> * The affliction of sickness far exceeds the pleasure of health.
> * An insult wounds us more than honor flatters us.
>
> For nature dispenses joys and sorrows so unequally that the latter affect us much more powerfully than the former.
>
> These reflections manifestly prove the delusiveness of worldly happiness.
