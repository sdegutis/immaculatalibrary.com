> UPON THE LOVE OF GOD IN GENERAL.
>
> A whole mountain of virtues, if destitute of this living, reigning, and triumphant love, was to Blessed Francis but as a petty heap of stones. He was never weary of inculcating love of God as the supreme motive of every action.
>
> The whole of his Theotimus ([The Treatise on the Love of God](/books/treatise-on-the-love-of-god.html)) breathes this sentiment, and he often told me that it was impossible to insist upon it too strongly in our teaching and advice to our people. He used to say:
>
>> For, in fact, what is the use of running a race if we do not reach the goal, or of drawing the bow if we do not hit the target?
>>
>> Oh! how many good works are useless as regards the glory of God and the salvation of souls, for want of this motive of charity!
>>
>> And yet, this is the last thing people think of, as if the intention were not the very soul of a good action, and as if God had ever promised to reward works not done for His glory, and not applied to His honour.
