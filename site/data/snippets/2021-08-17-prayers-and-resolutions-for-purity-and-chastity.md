> ### *Practical Resolution.*
>
> "Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God."
>
> ---
>
> To be near Jesus, and to be dear to Jesus, like Mary and Joseph, we must be pure and chaste.
>
> Heaven, the soul of man shall never possess, until she be purer than a sunbeam and whiter than the virgin snow.
>
> Chastity is a special gift of God.
>
> The inspired writer says: "I knew that I could not otherwise be continent except God gave .... I went to the Lord and besought him" (Wisd. viii. 21).
>
> Prayer, therefore, is the first means to preserve chastity.
>
> The second means is to avoid every dangerous occasion of sin.
>
> And the third is to subdue our sinful flesh by acts of mortification, and our proud spirit by acts of humility and self-denial.
>
> ---
>
> I resolve, therefore, by God's grace, to shun, all the days of my life, every occasion which I know from experience to be dangerous to holy purity; and, secondly, every day to practise some little acts of humility and self-denial known to God alone.
>
> O Jesus, grant me the grace to keep my resolutions.
>
> ---
>
> ### *Prayer.*
>
> O loving Jesus! make me pure. O sweet Jesus! make me chaste.
>
> To preserve purity, dearer to me than my life, O Jesus, grant me the spirit of prayer.
>
> O merciful Jesus! may I call upon Thee in the dark hour of temptation. Jesus, save me from the foul evil of impurity.
>
> Help me, O blessed Saviour, when I am tempted. May I die, O Jesus, take me out of life, O Lord, but never permit me to fall into mortal sin.
>
> O merciful Saviour, give me a living fear of sin, and the dangerous occasions of sin.
>
> "Pierce thou my flesh with Thy fear." O Blessed Lord, grant me a horror of pride, and love for humility.
>
> O Saviour, grant me the grace to shun sensuality of all sorts, and to love and practise mortification and self-denial.
>
> St. Joseph, obtain for me from Jesus purity of body and soul.
>
> ---
>
> "Guardian of Virgins, and holy father Joseph, to whose faithful custody Jesus Christ, Innocence itself, and Mary, Virgin of Virgins, were committed, I pray and beseech thee by these dear pledges, Jesus and Mary, that, being preserved from all uncleanness, I may, with spotless mind, pure heart, and chaste body, ever serve Jesus and Mary all the days of my life."

>
> Virgin most pure, Virgin most chaste, Virgin immaculate, pray for me, and obtain for me purity of soul and body.
>

> ### *Practice.*

> To-day practise four acts of self-denial: of the eyes, the tongue, the taste or appetite, and the will.
>
> ---
>
> ### *Aspiration.*
>
> O Jesus! make my heart and soul, my mind and body, as pure and chaste as the angels of God in Paradise.
