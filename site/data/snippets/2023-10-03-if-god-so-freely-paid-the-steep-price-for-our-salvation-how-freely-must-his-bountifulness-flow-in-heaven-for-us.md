> Another consideration which will help us to form some idea of the eternal beatitude promised us is the price which God, Who is so liberal, required for it.
> 
> After we had forfeited Heaven by sin, God, Who is so rich and magnificent in His rewards, would restore it to us only at the price of the Blood of His Divine Son.
> 
> The death of Christ, therefore, gave us life; His sorrows won for us eternal joy; and, that we might enter into the ranks of the celestial choirs, He bore the ignominy of crucifixion between two thieves.
> 
> Who, then, can sufficiently value that happiness to obtain which God shed the last drop of His Blood, was bound with ignominious fetters, overwhelmed with outrages, bruised with blows, and nailed to a cross?
> 
> But besides all these God asks on our part all that can be required of man. He tells us that we must take up our cross and follow Him; that if our right eye offend us we must pluck it out; that we must renounce father and mother, and every creature that is an obstacle to the Divine will.
> 
> And after we have faithfully complied with His commands the Sovereign Remunerator still tells us that the enjovment of Heaven is a gratuitous gift. “I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End,” He says by the mouth of St. John; “to him that thirsteth I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely.”
> 
> Since God so liberally bestows His gifts upon the sinner as well as the just in this life, what must be the inexhaustible riches reserved for the just in the life to come? If He be so bountiful in His gratuitous gifts, how munificent will He be in His rewards?
