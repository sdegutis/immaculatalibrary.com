> 56\.---How Innocence comes to Light.
> 
> In 1881 my brother, who is a tradesman, innocently became mixed up with a fraudulent concern. The real culprit had run away before my brother was arrested, which caused the trial to be delayed.
> 
> My family were greatly distressed at the long imprisonment of my brother, as they feared it would kill him or ruin his health, and wrote asking my assistance.
> 
> I had immediate recourse to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and to the immaculate heart of Mary, knowing that only they could assist me.
> 
> A short time after my brother wrote informing me that the real culprit had surrendered himself, and that the trial was about to take place. Very shortly afterward I received another letter from my brother, telling me he was acquitted.
> 
> I at once knelt down to thank the Sacred Heart, before whose statue I had, on the day of the trial, placed a lighted candle, and I also had a Mass of thanksgiving said next morning.
