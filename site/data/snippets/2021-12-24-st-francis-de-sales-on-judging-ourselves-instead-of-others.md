> *UPON JUDGING OURSELVES.*
>
> Blessed Francis has said:
>
>> We do exactly the reverse of what the Gospel bids us do. The Gospel commands us to judge ourselves severely and exactly, while it forbids us to judge our brethren.
>>
>> If we did judge ourselves, we should not be judged by God, because, forestalling His judgment and confessing our faults, we should escape His condemnation.
>>
>> On the other hand, who are we that we should judge our brethren, the servants of another? To their own Master they rise or fall.
>>
>> Let us not judge before the time until the Lord shall reveal what is hidden in darkness and pierce the wall of the temple to show what passes therein.
>>
>> Man judges by appearances only. God alone sees the heart; and it is by that which is within that true judgment is made of that which is without.
>>
>> So rash are we in our judgments that we as often as not seize the firebrand by the burning end; that is, we condemn ourselves while in the very act of rebuking others.
>>
>> The reproach of the Gospel, *Physician, heal thyself,* [St. Luke iv. 23.] we may take to ourselves.
>>
>> So also that other, *Why seest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, and seest not the beam that is in thy own eye?* [St. Matt. vii. 3.]
>>
>> To notice which way we are going is the first condition of our walking in the right way, according to the words of David, *I have thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.* [Psalm cxviii. 59.]
>>
>> So, on the other hand, we go astray if we do not pay attention to the path we are following. Judge not others and you will not be judged; judge yourselves, and God will have mercy on you.
