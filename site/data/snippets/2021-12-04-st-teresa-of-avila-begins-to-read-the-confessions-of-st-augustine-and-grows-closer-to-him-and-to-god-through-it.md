> At this time, the Confessions of St. Augustine were given me. Our Lord seems to have so ordained it, for I did not seek them myself, neither had I ever seen them before.
> 
> I had a very great devotion to St. Augustine, because the monastery in which I lived when I was yet in the world was of his Order; and also because he had been a sinner---for I used to find great comfort in those Saints whom, after they had sinned, our Lord converted to Himself. I thought they would help me, and that, as our Lord had forgiven them, so also He would forgive me.
> 
> One thing, however, there was that troubled me---I have spoken of it before---our Lord had called them but once, and they never relapsed; while my relapses were now so many. This it was that vexed me.
> 
> But calling to mind the love that He bore me, I took courage again. Of His mercy I never doubted once, but I did very often of myself.
>
> O my God, I am amazed at the hardness of my heart amidst so many succours from Thee. I am filled with dread when I see how little I could do with myself, and how I was clogged, so that I could not resolve to give myself entirely to God.
> 
> When I began to read the Confessions, I thought I saw myself there described, and began to recommend myself greatly to this glorious Saint.
> 
> When I came to his conversion, and read how he heard that voice in the garden, it seemed to me nothing less than that our Lord had uttered it for me: I felt so in my heart.
> 
> I remained for some time lost in tears, in great inward affliction and distress. O my God, what a soul has to suffer because it has lost the liberty it had of being mistress over itself!
> 
> And what torments it has to endure! I wonder now how I could live in torments so great: God be praised Who gave me life, so that I might escape from so fatal a death!
> 
> I believe that my soul obtained great strength from His Divine Majesty, and that He must have heard my cry, and had compassion upon so many tears.
