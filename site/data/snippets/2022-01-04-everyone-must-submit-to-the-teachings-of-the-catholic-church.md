> Before concluding this chapter we would make the following suggestion:
> 
> Notwithstanding the power and efficacy of this wisdom with which God fills the souls of the just, no man, however great the light he has received, should refuse to submit his judgment to his lawful superiors, especially the authorized teachers and doctors of the Church.
> 
> Who ever received greater light than St. Paul, who was raised to the third heaven; or than Moses, who spoke face to face with God? Yet St. Paul went to Jerusalem to confer with the Apostles upon the Gospel which be had received from Christ Himself; and Moses did not disdain to accept the advice of his father-in-law, Jethro, who was a gentile.
> 
> For the interior aids of grace do not exclude the exterior succors of the Church. Divine Providence has willed to make them both an aid to our salvation.
> 
> As the natural heat of our body is stimulated by that of the sun, and the healing powers of nature are aided by exterior remedies, so the light of grace is strengthened by the teaching and direction of the Church.
> 
> Whoever refuses, therefore, to humble himself and submit to her authority will render himself unworthy of any favor from God.
