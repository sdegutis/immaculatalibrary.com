> CHAPTER XXVIII.
>
> OF THOSE WHO REFUSE TO PRACTISE VIRTUE BECAUSE THEY LOVE THE WORLD.
>
> If we examine the hearts of those who refuse to practise virtue we shall frequently find a delusive love for the world to be one of the chief causes of their faint-heartedness.
>
> I call it a delusive love because it is founded on that imaginary good which men suppose they will find in the things of this world.
>
> Let them examine with closer attention these objects of their affection, and they will soon recognize that they have been pursuing shadows.
>
> If we study the happiness of the world, even under its most favorable aspects, we shall find that it is ever accompanied by six drawbacks, which tend very much to lessen its sweetness.
>
> No one will question the truth of this; for who can deny that the happiness of this life:
>
> 1. is brief,
> 2. that it is exposed to changes,
> 3. that it leads to danger
> 4. or blindness,
> 5. and that it frequently ends in sin
> 6. and deceit?
