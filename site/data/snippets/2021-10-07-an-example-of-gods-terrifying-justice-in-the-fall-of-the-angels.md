> The first work of God's justice was the reprobation of the Angels.
>
> "All the ways of God are mercy and justice," says David; but until the fall of the Angels divine justice had not been manifested. It had been shut up in the bosom of God like a sword in the scabbard, like that sword of which Ezechiel speaks with alarm, foretelling the ruin it will cause.
>
> This first sin drew the sword of justice from its scabbard, and terrible was the destruction it wrought. Contemplate its effects; raise your eyes and behold one of the most brilliant beings of God's house, a resplendent image of the divine beauty, flung with lightning-like rapidity from a glorious throne in Heaven to the uttermost depths of hell, for one thought of pride.
>
> The prince of heavenly spirits becomes the chief of devils. His beauty and glory are changed into deformity and ignominy. God's favorite subject is changed into His bitterest enemy, and will continue such for all eternity.
>
> With what awe this must have filled the Angels, who knew the greatness of his fall! With what astonishment they repeat the words of Isaias: "How art thou fallen from Heaven, O Lucifer, who didst rise in the morning!"
