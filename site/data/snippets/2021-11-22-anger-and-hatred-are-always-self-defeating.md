> Consider also that the fellow-creature whom you hate is either a just man or a sinner. If a just man, it is certainly a great misfortune to be the declared enemy of a friend of God. If a sinner, it is no less deplorable that you should undertake to punish the malice of another by plunging your own soul into sin.
>
> And if your neighbor in his turn seek vengeance for the injury you inflict upon him, where will your enmities end? Will there be any peace on the earth?
>
> The Apostle teaches us a more noble revenge when he tells us "not to be overcome by evil, but to overcome evil by good" [Rom. xii. 21.]---that is, to triumph by our virtues over the vices of our brethren.
>
> In endeavoring to be revenged upon a fellow-creature you are often disappointed and vanquished by anger itself. But if you overcome your passion you gain a more glorious victory than he who conquers a city. Our noblest triumph is won by subduing ourselves, by subjecting our passions to the empire of reason.
>
> Besides these, reflect on the fatal blindness into which this passion leads man. Under the cover of justice or right how often does it drive him to excesses which cause him a life-long remorse!
