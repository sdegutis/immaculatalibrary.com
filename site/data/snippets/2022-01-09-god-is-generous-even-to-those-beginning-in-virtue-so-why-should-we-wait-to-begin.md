> We find still another figure of this truth in the Old Testament where God commanded the first and the last days of the week to be observed with particular solemnity, thus teaching us that He rejoices with His children in the beginning as well as in the consummation of their perfection.
> 
> Those who are entering the path of virtue are treated by God with the tenderness and consideration which are shown to children.
> 
> The affection of a mother for her younger sons is not greater than that which she bears those of riper years, yet she tenderly carries the little ones in her arms and leaves the older ones to walk by themselves. The latter are sometimes obliged to earn their food before it is given them, while the little ones not only receive it unsolicited, but are tenderly fed. This is a faint image of the loving care with which God surrounds those who are beginning to serve Him.
> 
> It is no argument against this truth that you do not experience these divine consolations when you think of God. Food is tasteless to a disordered palate, and for a soul vitiated by sin and sensual affections this heavenly manna has no relish. Cleanse your soul with the tears of repentance, and then "taste and see that the Lord is sweet." [Ps. xxxiii. 9.]
> 
> What are all the pleasures of this world compared to these ineffable consolations? Why will you not begin to be happy from this moment?
> 
> "O man!" says Richard of St. Victor, quoting the words of the Gospel, "since Paradise may be thine, why dost thou not sell all thy possessions to purchase this pearl of great price?"
> 
> Dear Christian, delay not an affair so important. Every moment is worth more to you than all the riches of the universe. Even though you attain this heavenly treasure, you will never cease to lament the time you have lost, and to cry out with St. Augustine: "Too late have I known Thee, too late have I loved Thee, O Beauty ever ancient and ever new!"
> 
> This illustrious penitent, though he unceasingly lamented the lateness of his conversion, gave himself to God with all his heart, and, therefore, won an immortal crown. Do you imitate him, and thus avoid the unhappy lot of lamenting not only the delay of your conversion, but even the loss of your crown.
