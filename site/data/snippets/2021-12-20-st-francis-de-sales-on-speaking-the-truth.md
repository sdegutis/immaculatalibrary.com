> I replied:
> 
>> But truth is always truth in whatever language it may be couched, and in whatever sense it may be taken.
> 
> In support of this assertion I quoted the words spoken by St. Paul to Timothy:
> 
>> *Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season, reprove, entreat, rebuke in all patience and doctrine; but, according to their own desires, they will heap to themselves teachers having itching ears, and will, indeed, turn away their hearing from the truth, but will be turned into fables.* [1 Tim. iv. 2, 4.]
> 
> Our Blessed Father replied:
> 
>> The whole force of that apostolic lesson lies in the phrase: *In all patience and doctrine*. Doctrine signifies truth, and this truth must be spoken with patience.
>> 
>> When I use the word patience, I am trying to put before you an attitude of mind which is not one of confident expectation, that truth will always meet with a hearty welcome, and even some degree of acclamation; but an attitude of mind which is on the contrary prepared to meet with repulse, reprobation, rejection.
>> 
>> Surely, seeing that the Son of God was set for a sign of contradiction, we cannot be surprised if His doctrine, which is the truth, is marked with the same seal! Surprised! Nay, of necessity it must be so.
>> 
>> Consider the many false constructions and murmurings to which the sacred truths preached by our Saviour during His life on earth were exposed!
>> 
>> Was not this one of the reproaches addressed by Him to the Jews: *If I say the truth you believe me not.*
>> 
>> Was not our Lord Himself looked upon as an impostor, a seditious person, a blasphemer, one possessed by the devil? Did they not even take up stones to cast at him? Yet, He cursed not those who cursed Him; but repaid their maledictions with blessings, possessing His soul in patience.
> 
> Blessed Francis wrote to me on this same subject a letter, which has since been printed among his works, in which he expressed himself as follows:
> 
>> Everyone who wishes to instruct others in the way of holiness must be prepared to bear with their injustice and unreasonableness, and to be rewarded with ingratitude.
>> 
>> Oh! how happy will you be when men slander you, and say all manner of evil of you, hating the truth which you offer them.
>> 
>> Rejoice with much joy, for so much the greater is your reward in Heaven. It is a royal thing to be calumniated for having done well, and to be stoned in a good cause.
