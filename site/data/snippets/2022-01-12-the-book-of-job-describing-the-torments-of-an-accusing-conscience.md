> Of these torments one of the friends of Job spoke when he said, "The wicked man is proud all his days, and the number of the years of his tyranny is uncertain. The sound of dread is always in his ears"---the dread sound of an accusing conscience.
> 
> "And when there is peace, he always suspecteth treason," for he cannot escape the alarms and the warning cries of conscience.
> 
> "He believeth not that he may return from darkness to light." He believes it impossible to extricate himself from the terrible darkness which envelops him; he almost despairs of ever again enjoying the peace of a good conscience.
> 
> "Looking round about for the sword on every side," he is in constant dread of avenging justice.
> 
> "When he moveth himself to seek bread he knoweth that the day of darkness is at hand." Even at table, the place of mirth and rejoicing, the fear of judgment is upon him.
> 
> "Tribulation shall terrify him, and distress shall surround him, as a king that is prepared for the battle. For he hath stretched out his hand against God, and hath strengthened himself against the Almighty." [Job xv. 20-26.]
> 
> Thus does Holy Scripture portray the torments of which the heart of the sinner is both the theatre and the victim.
