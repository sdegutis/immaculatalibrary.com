> The goodness of this sovereign Being is so great, says St. Denis, that while creatures are offending Him and madly rebelling against His will He continues to give them the power and strength which they use to resist Him.
>
> How, then, can you be so rash, so ungrateful as to turn against God the blessings with which He has loaded you? Oh! incredible blindness! Oh! senseless rebellion!---that the members would conspire against their Head, for which they ought to be ready to make any sacrifice.
>
> But a time will come when God's outraged patience shall be avenged. You have conspired against God. It is just that He should arm the universe against you, that all creatures should rise up against you to avenge their Creator.
>
> They who closed their eyes to the sweet light of His mercy while it still shone upon them and allured them by so many benefits will justly behold it when, too late for amendment, they shall be groaning under the severity of His justice.
