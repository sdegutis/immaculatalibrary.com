> CHAPTER I.
> 
> That Everlasting and before the ages is the Only-Begotten.
> 
> What do they say to this [namely, In the beginning was the Word] who introduce to us the Son, as one new and of late, that so He may no longer be believed to be even God at all. For, says the Divine Scripture, *there shall no new God be in thee* [Ps. lxxxi. 9.]. How then is He not new, if He were begotten in the last times? How did He not speak falsely when He said to the Jews, Verily I say unto you, *Before Abraham was, I am* [Infra viii. 58.]? For plain is it and confessed by all, that many ages after the blessed Abraham was Christ born of the Holy Virgin. How at all will the words *was in the beginning* remain and come to anything, if the Only-Begotten came into being at the close of the ages? See I pray by the following arguments too how great absurdity, this cutting short the Eternal Being of the Son, and imagining that He came into being in the last times, yields.
> 
> But this same word of the Evangelist shall be proposed again for a finer test;
> 
> ***In the Beginning was the Word.***
> 
> Than *the beginning* is there nothing older, if it have, retained to itself, the definition of the beginning (for a beginning of beginning there cannot be); or it will wholly depart from being in truth a beginning, if something else be imagined before it and arise before it. Otherwise, if anything can precede what is truly *beginning*, our language respecting it will go off to infinity, another beginning ever cropping up before, and making second the one under investigation.
> 
> There will then be no beginning of beginning, according to exact and true reasoning, but the account of it [ὁ περὶ αὐτὴς Λόγος] will recede unto the long-extended and incomprehensive. And since its ever-backward flight has no terminus, and reaches up to the limit of the ages, the Son will be found to have been not made in time, but rather invisibly existing with the Father; for *in the beginning was* He. But if He *was in the begginning*, what mind, tell me, can over-leap the force of the *was*? When will the *was* stay as at its terminus, seeing that it ever runs before the pursuing reasoning, and springs forward before the conception that follows it?
>
> Astonishment-stricken whereat the Prophet Isaiah says, *Who shall declare His generation? for His Life is lifted from the earth* [Isaiah liii. 8. LXX.]. For verily lifted from the earth is the tale of the generation of the Only-Begotten, that is, it is above all understanding of those who are on the earth and above all reason, so as to be in short inexplicable. But if it is above our mind and speech, how will He be originate, seeing that our understanding is not powerless to clearly define both as to time and manner things originate?
