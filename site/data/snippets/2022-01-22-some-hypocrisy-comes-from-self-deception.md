> Besides that gross hypocrisy which is the pretence of virtue made by those who know they are wicked, but who strive to conceal their vices, there is a more refined and more dangerous hypocrisy, which affects many who deceive themselves as well as others by a false show of justice.
> 
> Like the Pharisee, they imagine they are virtuous, but they are far from true holiness. Such hypocrisy is the result of that miserable piety which consists of external practices only.
> 
> Solomon condemned it when he said: "There is a way which seemeth just to a man, but the ends thereof lead to death." [Prov. xiv. 12.]
> 
> Further on he includes this vice among the four evils which he says exist in the world: "There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother. A generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet are not washed from their filthiness. A generation whose eyes are lofty, and their eye-lids lifted up on high. A generation that for teeth hath swords, and grindeth with their jaw-teeth, to devour the needy from off the earth, and the poor from among men." [Ib. xxx. 11, 12, 13, 14.]
>
> You cannot fail to recognize among these the unhappy victims of self-deception, who, like the Pharisees, believe themselves pure when they are filled with corruption.
>
> This false confidence is so dangerous that there is much more hope for a hardened sinner who recognizes his condition than for one who thus deceives himself. Acknowledging our failings is the first step towards amendment. But how can a sick man be cured who maintains that he is well, and therefore refuses all remedies?
> 
> For this reason our Saviour declares to the Pharisees that "publicans and sinners shall go before them into the kingdom of Heaven." [St. Matt. xxi. 31.] And He utters the same truth still more forcibly in the Apocalypse: "would thou wert cold or hot. But because thou art luke-warm, and neither cold nor hot, I will begin to vomit thee out of my mouth." [Apoc. iii. 15, 16.]
