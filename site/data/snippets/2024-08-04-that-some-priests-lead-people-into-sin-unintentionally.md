> 2\. You know that the foundation of all must be a good conscience; you ought to make every effort to free yourselves even from venial sin and to do what is most perfect. One would suppose any confessor knew this; however, it is not the case. I had to consult one on matters of conscience who had gone through a whole course of theology, and he did me much harm by telling me certain matters were of no consequence. Not that he intended to deceive me, nor had he any motive for doing so, but he knew no better: I have since met with two or three like him. Everything depends on our having light to keep the law of God perfectly; on this basis prayer rests solidly; without this strong foundation the whole building is out of the perpendicular. There is need, then, for the nuns to consult men who are both spiritual and learned. If the confessor cannot lay claim to all this, let them occasionally see some one else: if they are forbidden to confess to any one but their regular confessor, let them seek counsel about their souls from such persons as I mentioned. I dare go further and say that the sisters should sometimes go to some other priest, even if their confessor possesses all these qualities, for he may be mistaken and it would not do for all to be misled by him. Nothing, however, must be done against obedience. Matters can always be arranged, and it is worth any trouble to help one soulâ€”how much more to help a number?
