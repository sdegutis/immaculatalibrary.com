> 2\. If thou seekest rest in this life, how then wilt thou come to rest everlasting?
>
> Set not thy self to seek for much rest, but for much patience.
>
> Seek true peace, not upon earth, but in heaven; not in men, nor in other things created, but in God alone.
>
> Thou must be willing, for the love of God, to suffer all things, viz. labours and sorrows, temptations and vexations, anxieties, necessities, sicknesses, injuries, detractions, reprehensions, humiliations, confusions, corrections, and contempts.
>
> These things help to obtain virtue: these try a novice of Christ: these procure a heavenly crown.
>
> I will give an everlasting reward for this short labour, and glory without end for transitory confusion.
