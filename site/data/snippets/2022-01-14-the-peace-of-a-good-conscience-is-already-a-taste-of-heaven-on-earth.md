> Having thus seen the sad effects of an evil conscience, we will be enabled to realize more fully the blessed peace which the just enjoy.
> 
> Virtue shelters them from the remorse and sufferings which have been described as the lot of the wicked.
> 
> The consolations and sweet fruits of the Holy Ghost fill them with joy and transform the soul into a terrestrial paradise, where He is pleased to take up His abode.

> "The joy of a good conscience," says St. Augustine, "makes the soul a true paradise." And elsewhere he says: "Be assured, ye who seek that true peace promised to a future life, that you may here enjoy it by anticipation, if you will but love and keep the commandments of Him Who promises this reward; for you will soon find by experience, that the fruits of justice are sweeter than those of iniquity. You will learn that the joys of virtue, even in the midst of trials and misfortunes, far exceed all the delights of pleasure and prosperity accompanied by the remorse of a bad conscience."

> Sin, as we have said, finds in its baseness and enormity its own punishment; so virtue finds in its beauty and worth its own reward.
> 
> David teaches us this truth: "The judgments of the Lord"---that is, His holy commandments---"are true, justified in themselves. More to be desired than gold and precious stones, and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb." [Ps. xviii. 10, 11.]
> 
> This was his own experience, for he says: "I have been delighted in the way of thy testimonies, as in all riches." [Ps. cxviii. 14.]
> 
> The chief cause of this joy is the dignity and beauty of virtue, which, as Plato declares, is incomparably fair and lovely.
> 
> Finally, so great are the advantages of a good conscience that, according to St. Ambrose, they constitute in this life the happiness of the just.
