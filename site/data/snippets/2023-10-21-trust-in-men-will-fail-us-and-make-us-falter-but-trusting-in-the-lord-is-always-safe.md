> Chap. XLV.â€”*That credit is not to he given to all men; and that men are prone to offend in words.*
> 
> 1\. *Grant me help, O Lord, in my tribulation, for vain is the aid of man.* Ps. lix.
> 
> How often have I not found faith there, where I thought I might depend upon it?
> 
> And how often have I found it where I did not expect it?
> 
> Vain therefore is all hope in men; but the safety of the Just is in thee, O Lord.
> 
> Blessed be thou, O Lord my God, in all things that befal us.
> 
> We are weak and unsettled, we are quickly deceived and changed.
> 
> 2\. Who is the man that is able to keep himself so warily, and with so much circumspection in all things, as not to fall sometimes into some deceit or perplexity?
> 
> But he that trusts in thee, O Lord, and seeks thee with a simple heart, does not so easily fall;
> 
> And if he lights into some tribulation, in what manner soever he may be entangled therewith, he will quickly be rescued or comforted by thee; for thou wilt not forsake forever him that trusts in thee.
> 
> A trusty friend is rarely to be found, that continues faithful in all the distresses of his friend.
> 
> Thou, O Lord, thou alone art most faithful in all things, and besides thee I there is no other such.
> 
> 3\. Oh! how wise was that holy soul that said, *My mind is strongly settled and grounded upon Christ.* &mdash;St. Agatha.
> 
> If it were so with me, the fear of man would not so easily give me trouble, nor flying words move me.
> 
> Who can foresee all things, or who is able to provide against ail future evils?
> 
> If things foreseen do yet often hurt us, how can things unlooked for fail of wounding us grievously?
> 
> But why did I not provide better for myself, miserable wretch as I am? Why also have I so easily given credit to others?
> 
> But we are men, and are but frail men, though by many we are reputed and called angels.
> 
> To whom shall I give credit, O Lord? to whom but thee? Thou art the truth, which neither canst deceive nor be deceived.
> 
> And on the other side, *Every man is a liar,* (Ps. cxi.) infirm, unstable, and subject to fail, especially in words; so that we ought not readily to believe even that which in appearance seems to sound well.
