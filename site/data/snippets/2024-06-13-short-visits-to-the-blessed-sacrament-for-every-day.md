> A SHORT VISIT TO THE BLESSED SACRAMENT BEFORE MEDITATION
> 
> *In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.*
> 
> I place myself in the presence of Him, in whose Incarnate Presence I am before I place myself there.
> 
> I adore Thee, O my Saviour, present here as God and man, in soul and body, in true flesh and blood.
> 
> I acknowledge and confess that I kneel before that Sacred Humanity, which was conceived in Mary's womb, and lay in Mary's bosom; which grew up to man's estate, and by the Sea of Galilee called the Twelve, wrought miracles, and spoke words of wisdom and peace; which in due season hung on the cross, lay in the tomb, rose from the dead, and now reigns in heaven.
> 
> I praise, and bless, and give myself wholly to Him, who is the true Bread of my soul, and my everlasting joy.
> 
> *Sunday*
>
> O Wisdom, coming forth from the mouth of the Most High, reaching from one end to the other mightily, and sweetly ordering all things: Come and teach us the way of prudence.
> 
> *(O Sapientia, quae ex ore Altissimi prodiisti, attingens a fine usque ad finem, fortiter suaviterque dis ponens omnia: Veni ad docendum nos viam pru dentiae.)*
> 
> *Monday*
>
> O Lord and Ruler the house of Israel, who appeared to Moses in the flame of the burning bush and gave him the law on Sinai: come, and redeem us with outstretched arms.
> 
> *(O Adonai, et Dux domus Israel, qui Moysi in igne flammae rubi apparuisti, et ei in Sina legem dedisti; Veni ad redimendum nos in brachio extento.)*
> 
> *Tuesday*
>
> O Root of Jesse, that stands for an ensign of the people, before whom the kings keep silence and unto whom the Gentiles shall make supplication: come, to deliver us, and tarry not.
> 
> *(O Radix Jesse, qui stas in signum populorum, super quern continebunt reges os suum, quern Gentes deprecabuntur; Veni ad liberandum nos, jam noli tardare.)*
> 
> *Wednesday*
>
> O Key of David and sceptre of the house of Israel; who opens and no one shuts; you close the door, and no one opens: Come and bring the prisoners from jail, those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death.
> 
> *(O Clavis David, et Sceptrum domus Israel, qui aperis et nemo claudit, claudis et nemo aperit; Veni, et educ vinctum de domo carceris, sedentem in tenebris et umbra mortis.)*
> 
> *Thursday*
>
> O Rising Sun, splendour of light eternal and sun of righteousness: Come and enlighten those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death.
> 
> *(O Oriens, Splendor lucis aeternae, et sol justitiae; Veni et illumina sedentes in tenebris et umbra mortis.)*
> 
> *Friday*
>
> O king of nations, and their desire, and cornerstone, who makes them one, come, and save humankind, which you formed from clay.
> 
> *(O Rex Gentium, et desideratus earum, lapisque angularis, qui facis utraque unum; Veni et salva hominem, quem de limo formasti.)*
> 
> *Saturday*
> 
> O Emmanuel, our King and Lawgiver, desire of the nations, and our Savior; come and set us free, oh Lord our God.
> 
> *(O Emmanuel, Rex et Legifer noster, Expectatio gentium, et Salvator earum; Veni ad salvandum nos, Domine Deus noster.)*
> 
> *The Latin Antiphons are taken from the Breviary in Advent.*
