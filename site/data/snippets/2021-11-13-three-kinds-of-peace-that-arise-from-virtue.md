> CHAPTER XIX.
>
> THE EIGHTH PRIVILEGE OF VIRTUE THE PEACE ENJOYED BY THE JUST.
>
> The liberty of the children of God is the cause of another privilege of virtue, no less precious than itself---the interior peace and tranquillity which the just enjoy.
>
> To understand this more clearly we must remember that there are three kinds of peace:
>
> 1. peace with God,
> 2. peace with our neighbor,
> 3. and peace with ourselves.
>
> Peace with God consists in the favor and friendship of God, and is one of the results of justification.
>
> The Apostle, speaking of this peace, says: "Being justified, therefore, by faith, let us have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." [Rom. v. 1.]
>
> Peace with our neighbor consists in a friendly union with our fellow-men, which banishes from us all ill-will towards them.
>
> David enjoyed this peace when he said: "With them that hated peace I was peaceable; when I spoke to them they fought against me without cause." [Ps. cxix. 7.]
>
> To this peace St. Paul exhorted the Romans: "As much as is in you, have peace with all men." [Rom. xii. 18.]
>
> Peace with ourselves is the tranquillity arising from a good conscience, and the harmony existing between the spirit and the flesh when the latter has been reduced to submission to the laws of reason.
