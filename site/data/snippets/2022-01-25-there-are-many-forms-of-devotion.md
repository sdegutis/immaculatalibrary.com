> *CHAPTER XLVI.*
> 
> *THE DIFFERENT VOCATIONS IN THE CHURCH.*
> 
> The virtues of the Christian life being very numerous, a good Christian does not necessarily give himself to all with the same ardor.
> 
> Some prefer to cultivate the virtues which have God for their direct object, and therefore embrace a contemplative life.
> 
> Others prefer the virtues which enable them to be most useful to their neighbor, and consequently choose an active life.
> 
> Others, in fine, prefer the virtues which more directly benefit their own souls, and therefore enter the monastic life.
> 
> Again, as all virtues are means of acquiring grace, different persons adopt different means.
> 
> Many seek to obtain it by fasting and like austerities; others by almsgiving and works of mercy, and others by prayer and meditation.
> 
> Of this latter exercise there are also different methods, which vary according to the character of souls or the subjects chosen.
> 
> The best kind of meditation is always that from which one derives most profit and devotion.
