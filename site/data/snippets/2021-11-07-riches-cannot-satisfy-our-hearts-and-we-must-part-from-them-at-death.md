> Moreover, all the riches of the world, did you possess them, would never satisfy the desires of your heart. They would only excite and increase them. However great the possessions you accumulate, there will be a continual void within you; you will never cease to long for more.
>
> In its pursuit of worldly possessions your poor heart fruitlessly exhausts itself, for it will never find content. It drinks deep at the fountains of pleasure, yet its thirst is never appeased. Its enjoyment of the possessions it has already acquired is destroyed by an insatiable thirst for more.
>
> Marvelling at the covetousness of the human heart, St. Augustine asks: "Whence is it that man is so insatiable in his desires while brutes observe a measure in theirs? They seek their prey only when they feel the cravings of hunger, and after this is appeased they are satisfied and rest. But the covetousness of the rich knows no limit; it is never satisfied, but is perpetually seeking more."
>
> Has not experience shown you also that where there are great riches there are many to consume, to steal, or to squander them?
>
> If you would free yourself from all the anxiety consequent on these cares, put yourself in the hands of God and fully confide in His providence, for He never forsakes those who trust in Him.
>
> Since He has subjected man to the necessity of seeking food, He will not permit him to perish from hunger. Could God, Who cares for the birds of the air and clothes the lilies of the field, be indifferent to the necessities of one of His noblest creatures?
