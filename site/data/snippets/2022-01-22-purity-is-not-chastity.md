> *UPON PURITY OF HEART.*
> 
> I can never express to you, or convey a right idea, of the high esteem in which he held purity of heart. He said that chastity of body was common enough even among unbelievers and among persons addicted to other vices; but that very few people could truly say, my heart is pure.
> 
> I do not say that by this purity of heart he meant the never being troubled by sinful desires, for that would be making the virtue of chastity to consist in insensibility; and what do those who are not tempted know about the matter?
> 
> No; he placed it in never yielding to unlawful affections. To these we should rather give the name of *infections*, since they infect the will, and interfere with the safe custody of the heart, which is the well-spring of the spiritual life.
