> CHAPTER XXI.
>
> THE TENTH PRIVILEGE OF VIRTUE: THE CONSOLATION AND ASSISTANCE WITH WHICH GOD SUSTAINS THE JUST IN THEIR AFFLICTIONS.
>
> As we have already remarked, there is no sea more treacherous or more inconstant than this life. No man's happiness is secure from the danger of innumerable accidents and misfortunes.
>
> It is, therefore, important to observe how differently the just and the wicked act under tribulation.
>
> The just, knowing that God is their Father and the Physician of their souls, submissively and generously accept as the cure for their infirmities the bitter chalice of suffering.
>
> They look on tribulation as a file in the hands of their Maker to remove the rust of sin from their souls, and to restore them to their original purity and brightness.
>
> They have learned in the school of the Divine Master that affliction renders a man more humble, increases the fervor of his prayers, and purifies his conscience.
>
> Now, no physician more carefully proportions his remedies to the strength of his patient than this Heavenly Physician, tempers trials according to the necessities of souls.
>
> Should their burdens be increased He redoubles the measure of their consolations. Seeing from this the riches they acquire by sufferings, the just no longer fly from them, but eagerly desire them, and meet them with patience and even with joy.
>
> They regard not the labor, but the crown; not the bitter medicine, but the health to be restored to them; not the pain of their wounds, but the goodness of Him who has said that He loves those whom He chastises. [Heb. xii. 6.]
>
> Grace, which is never wanting to the just in the hour of tribulation, is the first source of the fortitude which they display. Though He seems to have withdrawn from them, God is never nearer to His children than at such a time.
>
> Search the Scriptures and you will see that there is no truth more frequently repeated than this. "Call upon Me in the day of trouble," says the Lord; "I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me." [Ps. xlix. 15.] "When I called upon the Lord," David sings, "the God of my justice heard me; when I was in distress Thou hast enlarged me." [Ps. iv. 1.]
