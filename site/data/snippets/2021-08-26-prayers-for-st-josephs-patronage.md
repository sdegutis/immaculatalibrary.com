> "O most glorious Patriarch, my dear Patron, blessed are the eyes that see what thou now seest. I hope with holy Job, through the infinite merits of Jesus Christ, and by thy powerful intercession, that in my flesh I shall see my God, my Saviour. Stretch out for thy unworthy client those happy arms which so often carried and provided for the Son of God. Pray that I may live and die in God's fear and love. I most humbly beg that thou wilt prevail with thy Immaculate Spouse to join in prayer with thee, that I may be saved and numbered amongst the Elect. With profound humility I beseech thee to be present with me at the dreadful hour of my death. Amen."

> *A Prayer of St. Alphonsus Liguori to St. Joseph.*
>
> "O my holy Protector, St. Joseph, my sins deserve an evil end, but if thou dost defend me I cannot be lost. Not only hast thou been a dear friend of my Judge, but thou hast been, too, His guardian and foster-father. Commend me to Jesus, who for thy sake will receive me. I place myself under thy protection; receive me as thy servant for evermore. And in the name of the holy society of Jesus and Mary, of which thou didst enjoy the advantages in this life, obtain for me at the moment of my death a special assistance of Jesus and Mary. Amen."
>
> *Practice.*

>
> *Aspiration.*
>
> St. Joseph, obtain for me from Jesus a faithful correspondence with all the graces and secret inspirations of God.
