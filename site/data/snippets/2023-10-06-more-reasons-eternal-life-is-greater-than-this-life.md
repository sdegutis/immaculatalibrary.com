> Compare the inhabitants of the two countries, if you would have a still stronger proof of the superiority and infinite grandeur of the heavenly country.
> 
> This earth is the land of death, Heaven is the land of immortality. Ours is the habitation of sinners, Heaven the habitation of the just. Ours is a place of penance, an arena of combat; Heaven is the land of triumph, the throne of the victor, “the city of God.” “Glorious things are said of thee, O City of God!”

Great is thy Author, high the end for which thou wast created, and most noble the blessed citizens who dwell in thee.
