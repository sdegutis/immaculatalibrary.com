> Numerous are the titles which the Holy Scriptures use to express God's providence.
> 
> The one most frequently recurring is the sweet name of Father, which we find not only in the Gospel but also throughout the Old Testament.
> 
> Thus the Psalmist says: "As a father hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lord compassion on them that fear Him; for He knoweth our frame, He remembereth that we are dust." [Ps. cii. 13, 14.]
> 
> But because the love of a mother is deeper and more tender than that of a father, God makes use of it to express His care and solicitude for the just.
> 
> "Can a woman," He says by the mouth of His prophet, "forget her infant, so as not to have pity on the son of her womb? And if she should forget, yet will not I forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee in My hands; thy walls are always before My eyes." [Isaias xlix. 15, 16.]
> 
> What sweeter or more tender assurances of love could God express? And shall we continue blind to so many proofs of His tenderness?
> 
> And not content with illustrating His love for us by that of a mother, He compares His watchfulness to that of the eagle, a creature noted for its devotion to its young, saying by Moses: "As the eagle enticing her young to fly, and hovering over them, He spread His wings, and hath taken him and carried him on His shoulders." [Deut. xxxii. 11.]
> 
> Even more forcibly did Moses express the paternal goodness of God when he told the Israelites: "The Lord thy God hath carried thee, as a man is wont to carry his little son, all the way that you have come, until you came to this place." [Deut. i. 31.]
> 
> As our Father, God does not disdain to call us His children, His cherished children, as the prophet Jeremias attests when, speaking in the name of God, he says: "Surely Ephraim is an honorable son to Me, surely he is a tender child; for since I spoke of him I will still remember him. Therefore are my bowels troubled for him; pitying I will pity him." [Jer. xxxi. 20.]
> 
> Let us ponder these words, which are uttered by God Himself, that they may inflame our hearts and move us to make some return for His affectionate tenderness to us.
