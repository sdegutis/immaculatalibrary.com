> Consider by what means you were induced to make your protestation. Ah! how good and gracious was God to you at that time?
>
> Oh, tell me sincerely were you not invited to it by the sweet attractions of the Holy Ghost? Were not the ropes wherewith God drew your boat to that blessed haven composed of love and charity?
