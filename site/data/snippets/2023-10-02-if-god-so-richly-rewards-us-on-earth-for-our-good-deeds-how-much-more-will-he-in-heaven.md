> The Holy Scriptures teach us also with what liberality God rewards the services we render Him.

> We are told that when Abraham was about to sacrifice his son in obedience to God’s command, an angel of the Lord appeared to him and said; “By My own self have I sworn, saith the Lord: because thou hast done this thing, and hast not spared thy only-begotten son for My sake, I will bless thee, and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is by the sea-shore; thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemies; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed My voice.” Was not this a reward befitting such a Master? God is sovereign in His rewards as well as in His punishments.
> 
> We read also that David, reflecting one night that while he dwelt in a house of cedar the Ark of the Covenant was kept in a poor tent, resolved to build it a more fitting habitation; and the next day the Lord sent the prophet Nathan to promise in His name the following magnificent reward; “Because thou hast thought of building Me a house, I swear to thee that I will build one for thee and thy posterity which shall have no end, nor will I ever remove My mercies from it.” We see how faithfully His promise was fulfilled, for the kingdom of Israel was governed by the princes of the house of David until the coming of the Messias, Who from that time has reigned, and shall reign for all eternity.

> Heaven, then, is that superabundant reward which the faithful will receive for their good works. It is the manifestation of the Divine munificence, and of its greatness and glory we ought to have a lively appreciation.
