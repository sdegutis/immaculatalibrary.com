> 4\. How wisely didst thou forewarn us to take heed of men, *(Matt. x. 17.)* and that man's enemies are those of his own houshold. *(Ver. 36.)* And that we are not to believe, if any one should say, *Behold here, or behold there.* Matt. xxiv.
> 
> I have been taught to my cost, and I wish it may serve to make me more cautious, and not to increase my folly.
> 
> Be wary, saith one, be wary, keep in thyself what I tell thee: and whilst I hold my peace, and believe the matter to be secret, he himself cannot keep the secret which he desired me to keep, but presently discovers both me and himself, and goes his way.
> 
> From such tales and such unwary people defend me, O Lord, that I may not fall into their hands, nor ever commit the like.
> 
> Give to my mouth truth and constancy in my words, and remove far from me a crafty tongue.
> 
> What I am not willing to suffer, I ought by all means to shun.
> 
> 5\. O how good a thing and how peaceable it is to be silent of others, nor to believe all that is said, nor easily to report what one has heard; to lay one's self open to few; always to seek thee the Beholder of the Heart; and not to be carried about wiih every wind of words; but to wish that all things both within and without us may go according to the pleasure of thy will!
> 
> How secure it is for the keeping of heavenly grace, to fly the sight of men, and not to seek those things that seem to cause admiration abroad; but with all diligence to follow that which brings amendment of life and fervour!
> 
> To how many hath it been hurtful to have their virtue known, and overhastily praised? How profitable indeed hath grace been kept with silence in this frail life, which is all but a temptation and a warfare?
