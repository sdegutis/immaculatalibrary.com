> Is it not evident that this is one of the greatest privileges enjoyed by the just, to whom these consoling words are in a special manner addressed?
>
> "The eyes of the Lord are upon the just, and his ears unto their prayers." [Ps. xxxiii. 16.]
>
> "Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall hear; thou shalt cry, and He shall say: Here I am." [Isaias lviii. 9.]
>
> By the same prophet God promises more---to grant the prayers of the just even before they are addressed to Him.
>
> And yet none of these promises equal those of our Saviour in the New Testament.
>
> "If you abide in Me," He says, "and My words abide in you, you shall ask whatever you will, and it shall be done unto you." [St. John xv. 7.]
>
> "Amen, amen I say to you: if you ask the Father anything in My name, He will give it to you." [St. John xvi. 23.]
>
> Oh! promise truly worthy of Him Who utters it! What other power could offer such a pledge? Who but God could fulfil it?
>
> Does not this favor make man, in a measure, the lord of all things? Is he not thereby entrusted with the keys of Heaven?
>
> "Whatsoever you shall ask"---provided it lead to your salvation---"shall be given to you." There is no limitation, no special blessing---all the treasures of grace are offered to us.
>
> Ah! if men knew how to appreciate things at their true value, with what confidence would these words inspire them! If men glory in possessing the favor of an earthly monarch who places his royal power at their disposal, how much more reason have we to rejoice in the favor and protection of the King of kings!
