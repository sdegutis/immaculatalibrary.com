> But, perhaps, you will still object that your sins are so numerous that God must refuse you His grace.

> Away with such a thought! It is one of the greatest insults you could offer to God. By it you virtually say either that God cannot or will not assist His creatures when they implore His aid. Do not yield to such a blasphemy.
>
> Rather let your prayer be, with St. Augustine: "Give me grace, O Lord! to do what Thou commandest, and command what Thou pleasest." This prayer will always be answered, for God is ever ready to co-operate with man in doing good.

> God is the principal cause, man is the secondary. God aids man, as a painter aids a pupil whose hand he guides, that he may produce a perfect work. Both concur in the labor, but equal honor is not due to both.
>
> Thus does God deal with man without prejudice to his free-will. When the work, therefore, is accomplished, he glorifies God, and not himself, saying with the prophet: "Thou, O Lord! hast wrought all our works for us."
>
> Lean, then, on the power of God, and you will ever fulfil His will. Be mindful of the words. He addresses to you through Moses: "This commandment that I command thee this day is not above thee nor far off from thee. Nor is it in Heaven, that thou shouldst say: Which of us can go up to Heaven to bring it to us, that we may hear and fulfil it in work? Nor is it beyond the sea, that thou mayst excuse thyself, saying: Which of us can cross the sea and bring it unto us, that we may hear and do that which is commanded? But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, that thou mayst do it." [Isaias xxvi. 12.]

> Let these words assure you that however difficult God's commandments may appear, His grace will render their observance very easy, and if faithful to them you will soon experience that His yoke is sweet and His burden light.
