> Consider also the different effects of prosperity and adversity. The former inflates us with pride; the latter humbles and purifies us.
> 
> In prosperity we often forget to whom we owe all that we are; but adversity usually brings us to the feet of our Creator.
> 
> Prosperity often causes us to lose the fruits of our best actions; but adversity enables us to expiate our past failings, and preserves us against future relapses.
> 
> If you are afflicted by sickness, consider that God has doubtless permitted this to preserve you from the abuse you might have made of your health; for it is better to languish under bodily sufferings than gradually to destroy the life of the soul by sin.
> 
> Certainly God, Who is so merciful, takes no pleasure in our afflictions, but in His love He sends us these necessary remedies to cure our infirmities.
> 
> Thus suffering purifies the stains of sinful pleasures, and the privation of innocent gratifications expiates unlawful indulgence.
> 
> He punishes us in this world, that He may reward us in the next; He treats us with merciful rigor here to save us from His wrath in eternity.
> 
> Hence St. Jerome says that God's anger against sinners is never more terrible than when He seems to forget them during life. It was through fear of such a misfortune that St. Augustine prayed: "Here, O Lord! burn, here cut, that Thou mayst spare me in eternity."
> 
> Behold how carefully God guards you, that you may not abandon yourself to your evil inclinations.
> 
> When a physician finds the condition of his patient hopeless he indulges him in all his caprices, but while there is any hope of recovery he rigidly restricts him to a certain diet and forbids him all that could aggravate his malady.
> 
> In like manner parents refuse their children the money they have accumulated only for them when they find they are squandering it in play and riotous living.
> 
> Thus are we treated by God, the sovereign Physician and most loving Father of us all, when He sends us trials and privations.
