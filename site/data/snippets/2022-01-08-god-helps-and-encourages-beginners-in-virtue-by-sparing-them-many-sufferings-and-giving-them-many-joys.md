> You will probably tell me that these consolations are reserved for those who are already advanced in virtue.
> 
> No doubt these intimate joys of the soul are known only to more perfect souls, yet the Divine Master grants even beginners ineffable rewards.
> 
> The happiness of the prodigal, the rejoicing and feasting which resound in his father's house, are an image of the spiritual joy which the soul experiences when she is released from the slavery of the evil one and made an honored child of Christ.
> 
> It is very evident that man, bound by the chains of the flesh and the allurements of the world, could not trample pleasure under foot and resolutely enter the path of virtue, did not God accord him favors which sweeten all his sacrifices.
> 
> Therefore, when a soul is resolved to turn to God, He smooths the way for her, and removes many obstacles that might cause her to lose courage and fall back.
> 
> This is what God did for the children of Israel when He led them out of the land of Egypt: "When Pharao had sent out the people, the Lord led them not by way of the land of the Philistines, which is near, thinking lest perhaps they would repent, if they should see wars rise against them, and would return into Egypt." [Exod. xiii. 17.]
> 
> This same Providence which guided the Israelites continues daily to manifest like care for the faithful, bringing them out of the slavery of the world and leading them to the conquest of Heaven, the true promised land.
