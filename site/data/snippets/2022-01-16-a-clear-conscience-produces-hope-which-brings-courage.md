> CHAPTER XVII.
>
> THE SIXTH PRIVILEGE OF VIRTUE: THE CONFIDENCE OF THE JUST.
>
> The joy of a good conscience is always accompanied by that blessed hope of which the Apostle speaks when he tells us to rejoice in hope and to be patient in tribulation. [Rom. xii. 12.]
> 
> This is the rich inheritance of the children of God, their general refuge in tribulation, and their most efficacious remedy against all the miseries of life.
>
> Before entering upon this subject we must bear in mind that as there are two kinds of faith, one barren and dead, the other living and strengthened by charity, fruitful in good works; so there are two kinds of hope---one barren, which gives the soul no light in darkness, no strength in weakness, no consolation in tribulation; the other "lively" [1 St. Peter i. 3.] which consoles us in sorrow, strengthens us in labor, and sustains us in all the dangers and trials of this world.
>
> This living hope works in the soul many marvellous effects, which increase according as the charity which accompanies it becomes more ardent.
> 
> The first of these effects is the strength which supports man under the labors of life by holding before his eyes the eternal reward reserved for him; for, in the opinion of the Saints, the stronger this hope of reward the greater is man's courage in overcoming obstacles in the path of virtue.
