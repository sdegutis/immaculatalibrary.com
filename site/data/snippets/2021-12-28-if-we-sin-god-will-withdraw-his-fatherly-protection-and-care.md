> If unmoved by the loving providence of God towards the just, at least be not insensible to the rigor with which He punishes the wicked, to whom His justice is meted out according to their own measure.
> 
> For if they forget their Creator He will forget them. If they despise Him He will despise them. How miserable will their condition then be!
> 
> They will be as a school without a master, a ship without a rudder, a flock without a shepherd. "I will not feed you," God says; "that which dieth, let it die; and that which is cut off, let it be cut off. Let the rest devour every one the flesh of his neighbor." [Zach. xi. 9.] "I will hide my face from them, and will consider what their last end shall be." [1 Deut. xxxii. 20.]
> 
> The just punishment inflicted by God on the wicked is still more plainly declared in Isaias. [v. 5, 6.] The Prophet speaks of his people under the figure of a vine which has been carefully pruned and dressed, but has failed to bear fruit.
> 
> God, therefore, pronounces sentence against it: "I will show you what I will do to My vineyard. I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be wasted. I will break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down. And I will make it desolate; it shall not be pruned, and it shall not be digged; but briers and thorns shall come up; and I will command the clouds to rain no rain upon it."
> 
> That is, God will take from man all the efficacious help and protection which he ungratefully refused, and will leave him to inevitable ruin and destruction.
>
> What greater misfortune can befall a man than to be thus deprived of God's care in a world beset with dangers? With what arms will a creature so frail, helpless, and blind resist the attacks of the numerous enemies that assail him? Where will he find strength to resist them? Who will enlighten him, to enable him to avoid their snares? Without the divine assistance how can he avoid destruction?
