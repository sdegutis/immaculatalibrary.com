> 3\. But he who has not his heart *within*, nor God before his eyes, is easily moved with a word of dispraise:
> 
> Whereas he that trusts in me, and desires not to stand by his own judgment, will be free from the fear of men.
> 
> For I am the judge and discerner of all secrets; I know how the matter passed; I know both him that offers the injury, and him that suffers it.
> 
> From me this word went forth; by my permission it happened, *that out of many hearts thoughts may be revealed.* Luke ii.
> 
> I shall judge the guilty and the innocent; but by a secret judgment I would beforehand try them both.
> 
> 4\. The testimony of men oftentimes deceives: my judgment is true, it shall stand and not be overthrown.
> 
> It is hidden for the most part, and to few laid open in every thing; yet it never errs, nor can it err, though to the eyes of fools it seems not right.
> 
> To me therefore must thou run in every judgment, and not depend upon thy own will.
> 
> *For the just man will not be troubled whatever happens to him from God.* Prov. xii.
> 
> And if any thing be wrongfully pronounced against him, he will not much care; neither will he vainly rejoice, if by others he be reasonably excused; for he considers that *I am he that searcheth the heart and the reins,* (Apoc. ii.) who judge not according to the face, nor according to human appearance;
> 
> For oftentimes that is found blameworthy in my eyes, which in the judgment of men is esteemed commendable.
> 
> 5\. O Lord God, the best judge, strong and patient, who knowest the frailty and perverseness of men, be thou my strength, and all my confidence, for my own conscience sufficeth me not.
> 
> Thou knowest that which I know not; and therefore in every reprehension I ought to humble myself, and bear it with meekness.
> 
> Pardon me, I beseech thee in thy mercy, as often as I have not done thus, and give me again the grace to suffer still more.
> 
> For better to me is thy great mercy, for the obtaining of pardon, than the Justice which I imagine in myself for the defence of my hidden conscience.
> 
> Although my conscience accuse me not, yet I cannot hereby justify myself; for setting thy mercy aside, *no man living shall be justified in thy sight.* Ps. cxlii.
