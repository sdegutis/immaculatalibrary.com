> Bemember, moreover, that of all the pleasures of the senses those of taste and feeling are the lowest.
> 
> We have them in common with all animals, even the most imperfect, while there are many which lack the other three, seeing, hearing, and smelling.
> 
> These former senses, tasting and feeling, are not only the basest, but their pleasures are the least enduring, for they vanish with the object which produced them.
> 
> Add to these considerations the thought of the sufferings of the martyrs, and the fasts and mortifications of the Saints.
> 
> Think, too, of your many sins which must be expiated; of the pains of purgatory; of the torments of hell.
> 
> Each of these things will tell you how necessary it is to take up the cross, to overcome your appetites, and to do penance for the sinful gratifications of the past.
> 
> Remember, then, the duty of self-denial; prepare for your necessary meals with such reflections before your mind, and you will see how easy it will be to observe the rules of moderation and sobriety.
