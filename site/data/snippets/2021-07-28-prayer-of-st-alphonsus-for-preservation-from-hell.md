> Mother of God, most holy Mary! how often, by my sins, have I merited hell! Ere now the judgment had gone forth against my first mortal sin, hadst not thou, in thy tender pity, stayed awhile God's justice, and then softening my hard heart drawn me on to take confidence in thee.
>
> And oh! how often, in dangers which beset my steps, had I fallen, hadst not thou, loving Mother! that thou art, preserved me by the graces which thou didst obtain for me.
>
> My queen! what will thy pity and thy favor have availed me, if I perish in the flames of hell? If ever I have not loved thee, now, after God, I love thee above all things. Ah suffer not that I turn away from thee and from God, who through thee hath granted me so many mercies.
>
> Lady most worthy of all love! suffer not that I be doomed to hate and curse thee forever in hell. Couldst thou bear to see a servant whom thou lovest, lost forever? O Mary! say not so. Say not that I shall be among the lost, yet lost am I assuredly, if I abandon thee. But who can have the heart to leave thee? How can I ever forget the love which thou hast borne me? No, it is impossible for him to perish who hath recourse to thee, and who, with loyal heart, confides in thee.
>
> Leave me not to myself, my Mother! or I am lost. Let me ever have recourse to thee. Save me, my hope! save me from hell, and first from sin, which alone can cause my eternal ruin.
>
> *Three Hail Marys.*
