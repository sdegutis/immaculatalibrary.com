> Chap. XLVII.*â€”That all grievious things are to be endured for life everlasting.*
> 
> 1\. Son, be not dismayed with the labours which thou hast undertaken for me; neither let the tribulations which befal thee quite cast thee down; but let my promise strengthen thee, and comfort thee in all events.
> 
> I am sufficient to reward thee beyond all measure.
> 
> Thou shalt not labour here long, nor shalt thou be always oppressed with sorrows.
> 
> Wait a little while, and thou shalt see a speedy end of all thy evils.
> 
> The hour will come when labour and trouble shall be no more.
> 
> All is little and short which passeth away with time.
> 
> 2\. Mind what thou art about; labour faithfully in my vineyard; I will be thy reward.
> 
> Write, read, sing, sigh, keep silence, pray, bear thy crosses manfully; eternal life is worthy of all these, and greater combats.
> 
> *Peace* shall come in one day, which is known to the Lord; and it shall not be day, nor night, *viz.* such as is at present, but everlasting light, infinite brightness, steadfast peace, and secure rest.
> 
> Thou shalt not then say, *Who shall deliver me from the body of this death,* (Rom. vii.) nor shalt thou cry out, *Wo to me for that my sojourning is prolonged.* (Ps. cxix.) For death shall be no more; but never failing health, no anxiety, but blessed delight, and a society sweet and lovely.
