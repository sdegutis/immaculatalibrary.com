> ### Chap. XLII. â€” That our peace is not to be placed in men.
> 
> 1\. Son, if thou placest thy peace with any person, for the sake of thy contentment in his company, thou shall be unsettled and entangled;
> 
> But if thou hast recourse to the ever-living and subsisting Truth, thou shalt not be grieved when a friend departs or dies.
> 
> In me the love of thy friend must stand; and for me is he to be loved, whoever he be, who appears to thee good, and is very dear to thee in this life.
> 
> Without me no friendship is of any strength, nor will be durable; nor is that love true and pure of which I am not the author.
> 
> Thou oughtest to be so far mortified to such affections of persons beloved, as to wish (for as much as appertains to thee) to be without any company of man.
> 
> By so much the more does a man draw nigh to God, by how much the farther he withdraws himself from all earthly comfort.
> 
> So much the higher he ascends into God, by how much the lower he descends into himself, and by how much the meaner he esteems himself.
