> Epictetus, a pagan philosopher, fully appreciated this truth. He teaches us to behold the Creator in all His creatures, and to refer to Him all the blessings we receive from them.

> "When you are warned," he says, "of a change in the atmosphere by the redoubled cries of the crow, it is not the crow, but God Who warns you. And if the voice of men gives you wise counsel and useful knowledge, it is also God Who speaks. For He has given them this wisdom and knowledge, and, therefore, you must recognize His power in the instruments He wills to employ. But when be wishes to acquaint you with matters of greater moment He chooses more noble and worthy messengers."

> The same philosopher adds: "When you will have finished reading my counsels, say to yourself: It is not Epictetus the philosopher who tells me all these things; it is God. For whence in fact has he received the power to give these counsels but from God? Is it not God Himself, therefore, Who speaks to me through him?"

> Such are the sentiments of Epictetus. Should not a Christian blush to be less enlightened than a pagan philosopher? Surely it is shameful that they who are illumined by faith should not see what was so clear to them who had no other guide than the light of simple reason.
