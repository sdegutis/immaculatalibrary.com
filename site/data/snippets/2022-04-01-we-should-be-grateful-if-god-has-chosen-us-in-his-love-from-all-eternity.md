> No man, however, can be certain of his perseverance or election. Did not Solomon, the wisest of kings, after having lived virtuously for many years, fall into iniquity in his old age? Yet his example is one of the exceptions to the rule, which he himself teaches in these words: “It is a proverb: A young man according to his way, even when he is old he will not depart from it”; so that if his youth has been virtuous his old age will likewise be honorable. From these and similar indications to be found in the lives of the saints a man may humbly hope that God has numbered him among the elect, that his name is written in the Book of Life.

God Himself tells His Apostles: “Rejoice not in this, that spirits are subject unto you; but rejoice in this, that your names are written in heaven.” What, in fact, can be a greater happiness than to have been from all eternity the object of God’s love and choice; to have had a privileged place in His Heart throughout the eternal years; to have been chosen as the child of His adoption before the birth of His Son according to nature; and to have been always present to His Divine Mind, clothed in the splendor of the saints!
