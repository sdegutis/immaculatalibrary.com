> If you would learn how such promises are fulfilled, study the lives of the Saints and see what marvels they effected by prayer.
>
> What did not Moses accomplish by prayer in Egypt and throughout the journey of the Israelites in the desert? How wonderful were the works of Elias and his disciple Eliseus! Behold the miracles which the Apostles wrought!
>
> Prayer was the source of their power. It is, moreover, the weapon with which the Saints have fought and overcome the world. By prayer they ruled the elements, and converted even the fierce flames into refreshing dew. By prayer they disarmed the wrath of God and opened the fountains of His mercy. By prayer, in fine, they obtained all their desires.
>
> It is related that our holy Father, St. Dominic, once told a friend that he never failed to obtain a favor which he asked from God. Whereupon his friend desired him to pray that a celebrated doctor named Reginald might become a member of his order. The saint spent the night in prayer for this disciple, and early in the morning, as he was beginning the first hymn of the morning office, Reginald suddenly came into the choir, and, prostrating himself at the feet of the saint, begged for the habit of his order.
>
> Behold the recompense with which God rewards the obedience of the just. They are docile to the voice of His commandments, and He is equally attentive to the voice of their supplications.
>
> Hence Solomon tells us that "an obedient man shall speak of victory." [Prov. xxi. 28.]
>
> How differently are the prayers of the wicked answered! "When you stretch forth your hands," the Almighty tells them, "I will turn away my eyes from you; and when you multiply prayer I will not hear." [Isaias i. 15.]
>
> "In the time of their affliction," says the prophet, "they will say: Arise, O Lord! and deliver us. But God will ask: Where are thy gods whom thou hast made thee? Let them arise and deliver thee." [Jer. ii. 27, 28.]
>
> "What is the hope of the hypocrite, if through covetousness he takes by violence? Will God hear his cry when distress shall come upon him?" [Job xxvii. 8.]
>
> "Dearly beloved," says St. John, "if our heart do not reprehend us, we have confidence towards God; and whatsoever we shall ask we shall receive of Him, because we keep His commandments and do those things which are pleasing in His sight." [1 St. John iii. 21, 22.]
>
> "If I have looked at iniquity in my heart," the Royal Prophet tells us, "the Lord will not hear me"; but I have not committed iniquity, and "therefore God hath heard me, and attended to the voice of my supplication." [Ps. lxv. 18, 19.]
>
> It would be easy to find in Holy Scripture many similar passages, but these will suffice to manifest the difference between the prayers of the just and those of the wicked, and, by consequence, the incomparable privileges which the former enjoy.
>
> The just are heard and treated as the children of God; the wicked are rejected as His enemies. This should not astonish us, for a prayer unsupported by good works, devoid of fervor, charity, or humility, cannot be pleasing to God.
>
> Nevertheless, the sinner who reads these lines must not give way to discouragement. It is only the obstinately wicked who are rejected. It is only those who wish to continue in their disorders who are thus cut off.
>
> Though your sins are as numerous as the sands on the shore, though your life has been wasted in crime, never forget that God is your Father, that He awaits you with open arms and open heart, that He is continually calling upon you to return and be reconciled to Him.
>
> Have the desire to change your life; be resolved to walk in the path of virtue, and turn to God in humble prayer, with unshaken confidence that you will be heard.
>
> "Ask, and you shall receive; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you."
