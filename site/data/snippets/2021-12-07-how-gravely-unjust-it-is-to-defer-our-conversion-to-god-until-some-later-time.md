> But apart from all these considerations, if you have any sense of justice or honesty will not the benefits you have received and the rewards you are promised induce you to be less sparing in the service of so liberal a Master?
> 
> How wise is the counsel we read in Ecclesiasticus: "Let nothing hinder thee from praying always, and be not afraid to be justified even to death; for the reward of God continueth for ever." [Ecclus. xviii. 22.]
> 
> Since the reward is to continue as long as God remains in Heaven, why should not your service continue as long as you remain upon earth? If the duration of the recompense is limitless, why will you limit the time of your service?
>
> You hope, no doubt, to be saved; therefore, you must believe yourself of the number of those whom God has predestined. Will you, then, wait until the end of your life to serve Him Who has loved you and chosen you heir to His kingdom from all eternity? Will you be so ungenerous with Him Whose generosity to you has been boundless?
> 
> The span of human life is so limited, how can you dare rob this generous Benefactor of the greatest part, leaving Him only the smallest and most worthless portion? "Dregs alone," says Seneca, "remain at the bottom of a vessel."
> 
> "Cursed is the deceitful man," says God, "that hath in his flock a male, and making a vow offereth in sacrifice that which is feeble to the Lord; for I am a great King, saith the Lord of hosts, and My name is dreadful among the gentiles." [Mal. i. 14.]
> 
> In other words, none but great services are worthy of His greatness. Imperfect offerings are an affront to His majesty. Will you, then, give the best and most beautiful part of your life to the service of the devil, and reserve for God only that portion which the world refuses?
> 
> He has said that there shall not be in thy house a greater measure and a less that thou shalt have a just and true weight. [Deut. xxv. 14, 15.] Yet, in contradiction to this law, you have two unequal measures---a great one for the devil, whom you treat as your friend, and a small one for God, Whom you treat as your enemy.
>
> If all these benefits fail to touch you, do not be insensible to the favor your Heavenly Father has conferred upon you in giving His Divine Son to redeem you. Were you possessed of an infinite number of lives you would owe them all in payment---and they would be but a small return---for that Life, more precious than that of Angels and men, which was offered for you. How, then, can you refuse the service of your miserable life to Him Who sacrificed Himself for you?
