> The considerations already given are certainly sufficient to inspire us with a horror for sin; but to strengthen this salutary fear let us reflect upon the duration of these terrible torments.
>
> Try to realize what a comfort it would be to the damned if at the end of millions of years they could look forward to any term or alleviation of their sufferings. But no; their sufferings shall be eternal; they shall continue as long as God shall be God.
>
> If one of these unhappy souls, says a Doctor of the Church, were to shed one tear every thousand years, and if these tears accumulated to such a flood as to inundate the world, he would still be as far as ever from the end of his sufferings. Eternity would only be at its beginning.
>
> Is there anything worthy of our fears but this terrible fate? Truly, were the pain of hell no more than the prick of a pin, yet if it must continue for ever there is no suffering in this world which man should not endure to avoid it.
> 
> Oh! that this eternity, this terrible FOR EVER, were deeply graven in our hearts!
>
> We are told that a worldly man, giving himself to serious reflection upon eternity, made use of this simple reasoning: There is no sensible man who would accept the empire of the world at the expense of thirty or forty years spent upon a bed, even were it a bed of roses. How great, then, is the folly of him who for much smaller interests incurs the risk of being condemned to lie upon a bed of fire for all eternity! This thought wrought such a change in his life that he became a great saint and most worthy prelate of the Church.
>
> What consideration will be given to this by the soft and effeminate, who complain so much if the buzzing of a mosquito disturbs their night’s repose? What will they say when they will find themselves stretched upon a bed of fire, surrounded by sulphurous flames, not for one short summer night, but for all eternity?
>
> To such the Prophet addresses himself when he says; “Which of you can dwell with devouring fire? Which of you shall dwell with everlasting burnings?” O senseless man! will you continue to allow yourself to be deceived by the arch-enemy of your soul? How can you be so diligent in providing for your temporal welfare, and yet be so careless of your eternal interests?
