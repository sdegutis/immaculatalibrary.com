> XXV.

> If anyone blame or speak ill of thee unjustly, or if thy conduct be censured by one who is either thy inferior, or who, being more deserving of reprehension than thyself, should look to his own shortcomings, I would not have thee on that account fly into a passion, or fling aside the counsels which I have given thee, and refuse to examine thy conduct in the light of Godâ€”and this, from the intimate persuasion that thou art liable to go astray at every step if the grace of the Lord did not preserve thee.
