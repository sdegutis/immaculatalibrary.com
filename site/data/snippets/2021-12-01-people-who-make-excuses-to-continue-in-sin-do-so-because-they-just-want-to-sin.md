> CHAPTER XXIV.
>
> THE FOLLY OF THOSE WHO DEFER THEIR CONVERSION.
>
> The considerations offered in the preceding chapters should be more than sufficient to excite men to the love and practice of virtue.
>
> However, sinners never seem to be in want of excuses to defend their loose lives.
>
> "A sinful man," says the Scripture, "will flee reproof, and will find an excuse according to his will." [Ecclus. xxxii. 21.]
>
> "He that hath a mind to depart from a friend seeketh occasions." [Prov. xvii. 1.]
>
> Thus the wicked, who flee reproach, who wish to withdraw from God, are never without an excuse.
>
> Some defer this important affair of salvation to an indefinite future; others till the hour of death.
>
> Many allege that it is too difficult and arduous an undertaking.
>
> Many presume upon God's mercy, persuading themselves that they can be saved by faith and hope without charity.
>
> Others, in fine, who are enslaved by the pleasures of the world, are unwilling to sacrifice them for the happiness which God promises.
>
> These are the snares most frequently employed by Satan to allure men to sin, and to keep them in its bondage until death surprises them.
>
> At present we intend to answer those who defer their conversion, alleging that they can turn to God more efficaciously at another time.
>
> With this excuse was St. Augustine kept back from a virtuous life. "Later, Lord," he cried---"later I will abandon the world and sin."
>
> It will not be difficult to prove that this is a ruse of the father of lies, whose office since the beginning of the world has been to deceive man.
>
> We know with certainty that there is nothing which a Christian should desire more earnestly than salvation.
>
> It is equally certain that to obtain it the sinner must change his life, since there is no other possible means of salvation.
>
> Therefore, all that remains for us is to decide when this amendment should begin.
>
> You say, at a future day. I answer, at this present moment.
>
> You urge that later it will be easier. I insist that it will be easier now.
>
> Let us see which of us is right.
