> This treacherous vice begins in pleasure, but ends in an abyss of bitterness and remorse.
>
> There is nothing into which man is more easily drawn, but nothing from which he is with more difficulty freed.
>
> Hence the Wise Man compares an impure woman to a deep ditch, a narrow pit, to show how easily souls fall into this vice, but with what difficulty they are extricated.
>
> Man is first allured by its flattering aspect, but when he has assumed the sinful yoke, and particularly when he has cast aside all shame, it requires almost a miracle of grace to deliver him from his degrading bondage.
>
> For this reason it is justly compared to a fisherman's net, which the fish easily enter, but from which they rarely escape.
