> *For Persons who have Nothing to Confess.*
> 
> There was once a distinguished lady who went often to confession, and consequently was very much at her ease, as if she had no sin on her soul.
>
> St. Margaret of Cortona, who used to pray most fervently for this lady, received from the Lord a commission to communicate the following suggestions to her confessor, that he might place them before his penitent, and thus guide her to a heartfelt and penitential confession.
>
> The suggestions were:
>
> * that prior to her marriage she had been frivolous and not altogether modest;
> * that at the time of her marriage she adorned herself extravagantly, taking little or no pleasure in the things of God;
> * that during her married life many things took place that were unbecoming her state of life, and this even on festivals of the Church;
> * that in a certain lawsuit with one of her acquaintances, she would have gladly brought about an unfair decision;
> * that when she went out she wished to appear more beautiful than other women;
> * that she pretended to be friendly to the members of her household, while she found fault with them behind their backs;
> * that she loved no one but her husband and her sons, and these to an excess;
> * that she never had a true solid contrition for all her sins, and even in the holiest season performed her devotions tepidly;
> * that her fasts were devoid of meritorious intention;
> * that she was too fond of good food and gave luxurious and ostentatious banquets;
> * that she was not freehanded in her almsgiving, and looked for worldly reward for what she did give;
> * that she arrayed herself in costly attire, and had no concern for those who had to toil in nakedness and cold;
> * that she was imperative and overbearing towards her household;
> * that she spoke ill of others behind their back, disparaging their good qualities, and censuring their every motion, and rejoicing at their discomfiture;
> * that, instead of regretting the evil ways of others, she found satisfaction in retailing them among neighbors;
> * that she was agreeable and flattering to persons whom she afterward ridiculed in their absence;
> * that she was covetous and greedy for good things;
> * that in church she did not fix her heart on God, but permitted her thoughts to dwell on earthly things;
> * that she censured the service and sermon;
> * that she did not serve God with pure motives;
> * that she took pleasure in looking at herself in the glass, and envied the good appearance of other women;
> * that she exaggerated her own slight trials, and belittled the heavy afflictions of others, and had no compassion for them;
> * that she was proud and shunned the simple and lowly.
