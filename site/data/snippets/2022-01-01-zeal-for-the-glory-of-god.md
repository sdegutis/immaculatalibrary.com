> *Zeal for the Glory of God.*
> 
> Zeal consists in promoting the honor of God and striving to advance the fulfilment of His will on earth, even as it is accomplished in Heaven.
> 
> If we love God we cannot but be pierced with grief to behold so many not only neglecting to obey His holy will, but even acting in a manner directly opposed to it.
> 
> Full of this zeal was David when he cried out: "The zeal of Thy house hath eaten me up." [Ps. lxviii. 10.]
> 
> Strive to imitate him, doing what you can by word and example, as well as by prayer, to increase the honor of God through the salvation of souls.
> 
> Thus may you hope to receive that mark, mentioned by the prophet, which will sign you as one of the elect of God. [Ezech. ix. iv.]
