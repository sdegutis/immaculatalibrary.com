> If we are at the head of a house we must be careful to see that all under our charge hear Mass, not only on Sundays, but also on holydays.
> 
> Too much laxity regarding holydays is apt to prevail among those who earn their bread by the sweat of their brow.
> 
> They should remember that the obligation to hear Mass on a holyday is the same as the obligation to hear it on Sunday.
> 
> Consequently they must make serious and sincere efforts to comply with this duty.
> 
> To attend an early Mass may involve the loss of a little sleep, but they should remember that these holydays occur but seldom, and that they must do something to atone for their sins and to merit the kingdom of Heaven.
> 
> Parents and employers will have a severe account to render to God if they cause or permit those confided to their care to neglect this sacred duty.
> 
> When there is a just reason, such as the care of the sick or any other pressing necessity which prevents our hearing Mass, we are released from the obligation.
