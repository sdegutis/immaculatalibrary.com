> CHAPTER V.
>
> THE FIFTH MOTIVE WHICH OBLIGES US TO PRACTISE VIRTUE: THE BENEFIT OF OUR JUSTIFICATION.
>
> What would the benefit of Redemption avail us, if it had not been followed by that of justification, through which the sovereign virtue of Redemption is applied to our souls?
>
> For as the most excellent remedies avail us nothing if not applied to our disorders, so the sovereign remedy of Redemption would be fruitless were it not applied to us through the benefit of justification.
>
> This is the work of the Holy Ghost, to whom the sanctification of man in a special manner belongs. It is He Who attracts the sinner by His mercy, Who calls him, Who leads him in the ways of wisdom, Who justifies him, Who raises him to perfection, Who imparts to him the gift of perseverance, to which, in the end, He will add the crown of everlasting glory. These are the different degrees of grace contained in the inestimable benefit of justification.
