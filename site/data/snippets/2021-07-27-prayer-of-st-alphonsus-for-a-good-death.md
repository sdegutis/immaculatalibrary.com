> #### *For a Good Death.*
>
> Holiest Mary, Mother of goodness! Mother of mercy! when I reflect on my sins and on the moment of my death, I tremble and am filled with confusion. My sweetest Mother! in the blood of Jesus, and in thy intercession are my hopes.
>
> Comfort of the afflicted! abandon me not at my death agony; fail not to console me in that great affliction. If even now I am so tormented with remorse for sin, connected by the uncertainty of forgiveness, by the danger of a relapse, and the rigor of divine justice, how will it be then?
>
> Mother! before death overtakes me, obtain for me a great sorrow for my sins, a true amendment, and a constant fidelity to God in all that yet remains to me of life.
>
> And when, indeed, my hour is come, then do thou, Mary! be my hope, be thou mine aid in the anguish in which my soul will be overwhelmed; when the enemy sets before my face my sins, oh! comfort me then, that I may not despair.
>
> Obtain for me at that moment to invoke thee often, that with thine own sweet name and that of thy most holy Son upon my lips, I may breathe forth my spirit. This grace thou hast granted to many of thy servants: I, too, desire it and hope to obtain it.
>
> *Three Hail Marys.*
