> Consider, farther, that the more you indulge in these infamous gratifications, the more insatiable will be your desire for them, the less they will satisfy you. It is the nature of these pleasures to excite the appetite rather than appease it.
>
> If you consider how fleeting is the pleasure and how enduring its punishment, you will not for a moment's enjoyment sacrifice the unspeakable treasure of a good conscience in this life and the eternal happiness of Heaven in the next.
>
> St. Gregory, therefore, has truly said that the pleasure is momentary, but the suffering is eternal. ["Moral.," ix. 44.]
