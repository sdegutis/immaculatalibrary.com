> Section IV.
> 
> On the Commandments of the Church.
> 
> Besides these sins against the Commandments of God there are those against the commandments of the Church, which also impose upon us a grave obligation.
>
> Such are the precepts to:
>
> 1. hear Mass on Sundays and holydays of obligation;
>
> 2. to confess our sins at least once a year,
>
> 3. and to receive the Holy Eucharist at Easter or thereabouts;
>
> 4. to pay tithes to our pastor,
>
> 5. and to observe the days of fasting and abstinence prescribed by the Church.
>
> The precept of fasting is binding from the age of twentyone and upwards; that of abstinence obliges all who have attained the age of reason. The sick, the convalescent, nursing women, women in pregnancy, those whose labors are severe, and those who are too poor to afford one full meal a day, are exempt from the law of fasting. There may be other lawful reasons for dispensation, for which the faithful ought to apply to their pastor or confessor, and not take it upon themselves to set aside the law of the Church.
>
> The difference between abstinence and fasting should be remembered. By fasting we mean eating only one full meal in the day, with a slight collation in the evening. By abstinence we mean giving up the use of flesh-meat. It should be borne in mind, therefore, on Ember days and at other times of fast, that the law is not fulfilled by simply abstaining from meat. Except you are excused by some of the reasons given above or by dispensation, you must observe the fast by eating only one full meal, with the collation in the evening, and a warm drink, with a cracker or small piece of bread, in the morning.
>
> In regard to hearing Mass, we must endeavor to be present at the Holy Sacrifice not only in body but in mind, with silence and recollection, having our thoughts fixed upon the mystery of the altar, or upon some other pious subject. The recital of devout prayers, especially the Rosary, is an excellent means of keeping ourselves united with God.
