> CHAPTER XXVII.
>
> *In what manner the Devil tempts and seduces those who are willing to embrace virtue, or are still plunged in vice.*
>
> It is certain the Devil is continually seeking the destruction of mankind, and has various ways of working his ends.
>
> In order, therefore, to let you see some of his stratagems, we will consider different sorts of persons in different dispositions.
>
> * Some, overwhelmed with iniquity, think not of breaking their chains;
> * others are willing to free themselves from their thraldom, but do nothing towards it;
> * others again think themselves in a good way, but by that means are very far from it;
> * others, in fine, after attaining a high degree of virtue, fall into a more dangerous condition than before.
>
> In the following chapters we shall consider these several sorts of persons.
