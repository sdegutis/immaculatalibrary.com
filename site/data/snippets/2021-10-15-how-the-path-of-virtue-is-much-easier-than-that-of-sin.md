> Though we acknowledge that in every condition of life there are trials and difficulties, yet the path of the wicked is far more thickly strewn with hardships than is that of the just.
>
> One necessarily grows weary in a long journey, but a blind man who stumbles at every step will certainly tire sooner than the traveller who clearly sees and guards against the obstacles in the way.
>
> In the journey of life we must expect to feel fatigue and experience hardships until we reach our destination.
>
> The sinner, guided by passion, walks blindly, and therefore often falls. The just man, guided by reason, sees and avoids the rocks and precipices, and thus travels with less fatigue and more safety.
>
> "The path of the just," says Solomon, "as a shining light goeth forward and increaseth even to perfect day; but the way of the wicked is darksome, and they know not where they fall." And not only is it dark, but also slippery, as holy David tells us.
>
> Judge, then, what a difference there is between these two paths. Behold how excessive are the difficulties which beset the wicked.
>
> Reflect, moreover, that the just find a thousand means of alleviating their trials which the sinner does not experience.
>
> They have God's fatherly providence to guide them; the grace of the Holy Spirit to enlighten and encourage them; the sacraments to sanctify them; the divine consolations to refresh them; the example of the pious to animate them; the writings of the Saints to instruct them; the testimony of a good conscience to comfort them; the hope of future glory to sustain them, besides the numerous other favors which the virtuous enjoy.
>
> Hence they are ever ready to sing with the prophet, "How sweet, O Lord! are Thy words to my palate, more than honey to my mouth."
