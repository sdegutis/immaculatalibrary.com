> 
> I teach to despise all earthly things, to loathe things present, to seek things eternal, to relish things eternal, to fly honours, to endure scandals, to repose all hope in me, to desire nothing out of me, and above all things ardently to love me.

> But to some I speak things common, to others things more particular; to some I sweetly appear in signs and figures; to others in great light I reveal mysteries.
> 
> The voice of the books is the same, but it teacheth not all men alike; because I within am the teacher of truth, the searcher of hearts, the understander of thoughts, the promoter of actions; distributing to every one as I judge fitting.
