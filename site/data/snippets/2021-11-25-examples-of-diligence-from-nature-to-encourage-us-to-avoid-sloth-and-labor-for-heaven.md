> Turn your eyes towards nature, and you will find nothing idle.
>
> The heavens, by their perpetual motion, unceasingly proclaim the glory of their Creator.
>
> The sun, moon, and stars, with all the brilliant planets which people almost infinite space, daily follow their courses for the benefit of man.
>
> The growth of plants and trees is continual until they have attained their appointed strength and proportions.
>
> Behold the untiring energy with which the ant labors for its winter's food; with which the bees toil in building their hives and storing them with honey.
>
> These industrious little creatures will not allow an idler to exist among them; the drones are all killed.
>
> Throughout nature you find the same lesson. Will not man, therefore, blush for a vice which the instinct of irrational creatures teaches them to avoid?
>
> To what labors do not men condemn themselves for the acquisition of perishable riches, the preservation of which, when they are obtained, is an ever-increasing source of care and anxiety!
>
> You are striving for the kingdom of Heaven. Will you show less energy, will you be less diligent, in toiling for spiritual treasures, which can never be taken from you?
>
> If you will not profit by time and strength to labor now, a day will come when you will vainly seek these present opportunities. Sad experience tells us how many have thus been disappointed. Life is short, and obstacles to good abound.
>
> Do not, therefore, let the promptings of sloth cause you to lose advantages which will never return, for "the night cometh when no man can work." [St. John ix. 4.]
