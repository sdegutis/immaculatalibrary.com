> O holy night, the stars are brightly shining,  
> It is the night of the dear Saviourâ€™s birth;  
> Long lay the world in sin and error pining,  
> 'Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth.  
> A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,  
> For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn;  
>   
> Fall on your knees,  
> Oh hear the angel voices!  
> O night divine!  
> O night when Christ was born.  
> O night divine,  
> O night, O night divine.  
>   
> Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming;  
> With glowing hearts by his cradle we stand:  
> So, led by light of a star sweetly gleaming,  
> Here came the wise men from the Orient land,  
> The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger,  
> In all our trials born to be our friend;  
>   
> He knows our need, To our weakness no stranger!  
> Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!  
> Behold your King! your King! before him bend!  
>   
> Truly He taught us to love one another;  
> His law is Love and His gospel is Peace;  
> Chains shall he break, for the slave is our brother,  
> And in his name all oppression shall cease,  
> Sweet hymns of joy in grateful Chorus raise we;  
> Let all within us praise his Holy name!  
>   
> Christ is the Lord, then ever and ever praise we!  
> His pow'r and glory, evermore proclaim!  
> His pow'r and glory, evermore proclaim!
