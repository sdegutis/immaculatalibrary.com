> We Three Kings of Orient are,   
> Bearing gifts we traverse afar,   
> Field and fountain,   
> Moor and mountain,   
> Following yonder Star.   
>    
>    
> Star of Wonder, Star of Night,   
> Star with Royal Beauty bright,   
> Westward leading,   
> Still proceeding,   
> Guide us to Thy perfect Light.   
>    
>    
> [Gaspard]   
>    
> Born a King on Bethlehem plain,   
> Gold I bring to crown Him again,   
> King for ever,   
> Ceasing never   
> Over us all to reign.   
> O Star, &c.   
>    
>    
> [Melchior]   
>    
> Frankincense to offer have I,   
> Incense owns a Deity nigh:   
> Prayer and praising   
> All men raising,   
> Worship Him God Most High.   
> O Star, &c.   
>    
>    
> [Balthazar]   
>    
> Myrrh is mine; its bitter perfume   
> Breathes a life of gathering gloom;—   
> Sorrowing, sighing,   
> Bleeding, dying,   
> Sealed in the stone-cold tomb.   
> O Star, &c.   
>    
>    
> Glorious now behold Him arise,   
> King, and God, and Sacrifice;   
> Heav’n sings Hallelujah:   
> Hallelujah the earth replies.   
> O Star, &c.
