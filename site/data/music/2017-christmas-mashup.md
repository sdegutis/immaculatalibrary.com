### Come ye lofty, come ye lowly

> Come ye lofty, come ye lowly
> Let your songs of gladness ring;
> In a stable lies the Holy,
> In a manger rests the King:
> See in Mary's arms reposing
> Christ by highest heav'n adored:
> Come, your circle 'round Him closing,
> Pious hearts that love the Lord.
> 
> Come ye poor, no pomp of station
> Robes the Child your hearts adore:
> He, the Lord of all salvation,
> Shares your want, is weak and poor:
> Oxen, round about behold them;
> Rafters naked, cold, and bare,
> See the Shepherds, God has told them
> That the Prince of Life lies there.
> 
> Come ye children blithe and merry,
> This one Child your model make;
> Christmas holly, leaf, and berry,
> All be prized for His dear sake:
> Come ye gentle hearts and tender,
> Come ye spirits keen and bold;
> All in all your homage render,
> Weak and mighty, young and old.
> 
> High above a star is shining,
> And the wise men haste from far:
> Come glad hearts, and spirits pining--
> For you all has ris'n the star.
> Let us bring our poor oblations,
> Thanks and love, and faith and praise;
> Come ye people, come ye nations,
> All in all draw nigh to gaze.
