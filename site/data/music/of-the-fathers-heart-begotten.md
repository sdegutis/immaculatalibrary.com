> Of the Father’s heart begotten,   
> Ere the world from chaos rose,   
> He is Alpha: from that Fountain   
> All that is and hath been flows;  
> He is Omega, of all things   
> Yet to come the mystic Close,  
> Evermore and evermore.   
>   
> By his word was all created;   
> He commanded and ‘twas done;  
> Earth and sky and boundless ocean,   
> Universe of three in one,  
> All that sees the moon’s soft radiance,   
> All that breathes beneath the sun,  
> Evermore and evermore.   
>   
> He assumed this mortal body,   
> Frail and feeble, doomed to die,   
> That the race from dust created   
> Might not perish utterly,  
> Which the dreadful Law had sentenced   
> In the depths of hell to lie,  
> Evermore and evermore.  
>   
> O How blest that wondrous birthday,   
> When the Maid the curse retrieved,  
> Brought to birth mankind’s salvation,   
> By the Holy Ghost conceived;  
> And the Bade, the world’s Redeemer,   
> In her loving arms received,  
> Evermore and evermore.  
>   
> This is he, whom seer and sibyl   
> Sang in ages long gone by;  
> This is he of old revealed   
> In the page of prophecy;   
> Lo! he comes, the promised Savior;   
> Let the world his praises cry!  
> Evermore and evermore.  
>   
> Sing, ye heights of heav’n, his praises;   
> Angels and Archangels, sing!  
> Wheresoe’er ye be, ye faithful,   
> Let your joyous anthems ring,  
> Ev’ry tongue his name confessing,   
> Countless voices answering,  
> Evermore and evermore
