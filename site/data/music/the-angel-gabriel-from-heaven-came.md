> The angel Gabriel from heaven came  
> His wings as drifted snow his eyes as flame  
> "All hail" said he "thou lowly maiden Mary,  
> Most highly favored lady," Gloria!  
>   
> "For know a blessed mother thou shalt be,  
> All generations laud and honor thee,  
> Thy Son shall be Emanuel, by seers foretold  
> Most highly favored lady," Gloria!  
>   
> Then gentle Mary meekly bowed her head  
> "To me be as it pleaseth God," she said,  
> "My soul shall laud and magnify his holy name."  
> Most highly favored lady. Gloria!  
>   
> Of her, Emanuel, the Christ was born  
> In Bethlehem, all on a Christmas morn  
> And Christian folk throughout the world will ever say:  
> "Most highly favored lady," Gloria!
