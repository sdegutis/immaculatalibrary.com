> King of glory, King of peace,
> I will love Thee;
> and that love may never cease,
> I will move Thee.
> Thou hast granted my request,
> Thou hast heard me;
> Thou didst note my working breast,
> Thou hast spared me.
> 
> Wherefore with my utmost art
> I will sing Thee,
> and the cream of all my heart
> I will bring Thee.
> Though my sins against me cried,
> Thou didst clear me;
> and alone, when they replied,
> Thou didst hear me.
> 
> Sev'n whole days, not one in sev'n,
> I will praise Thee;
> in my heart, though not in heav'n,
> I can raise Thee.
> Small it is, in this poor sort
> to enroll Thee:
> e'en eternity's too short
> to extol Thee.
