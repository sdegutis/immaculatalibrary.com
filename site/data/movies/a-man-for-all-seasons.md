### Overview

The last 7 years of the life of St. Thomas More, centering on the conflict between King Henry VIII and the Catholic Church, and how Thomas More got caught in the middle of it unwillingly, and how he tried to escape danger without disobeying his conscience.

### Review

Amazing movie that does justice to St. Thomas More's life, principles, integrity, understanding of conscience, of law, and of religion. Takes good portions of its dialogue straight from official sources, and takes very few liberties, but ones that seem very true to his spirit based on books we have by him and about him.

### Caveats

* King Henry yells a lot and can be scary or confusing for kids.
* The jail scene is too emotional for young kids.
* The execution would traumatize young kids.

The rest of it is family friendly.
