### Overview

A very well made movie that tells the basic story of St. Don Bosco and his compassion for the abandoned youth of Turin, Italy.

### Review

Shows his courage and virtues, some of his persecutions, some miracles of God's Divine Providence, and mentions his dreams. Overall very well done.

### Caveats

Much of it is family friendly, but several big scenes are not appropriate for young children:

* Don Bosco is attacked by a man with a knife
* Several emotional love-story scenes
* A fight between two men over a woman
* A mom puts her daughter in danger for money
* A jail scene
* A splashing scene that goes on way too long

Kids will not get much out of it anyway. Best for teens and up.
