Movie about St. Pedro Poveda who helped the poor and assisted young women in modern times.

### Review

Interesting movie.

### Caveats

Some scary scenes are inappropriate for children or sensitive viewers, such as an execution in the background more than halfway through the movie, and dead bodies shown at the end.
