### Overview

Summary of the life of St. Teresa of Calcutta, popularly known as Mother Teresa, from her vocation of helping the poor, to her death.

### Review

Very good and inspiring movie about St. Teresa of Calcutta. Shows her faith, her trust in God's providence, her spiritual battles and her persecutions.

### Caveats

Some intense scenes at the beginning involving her father's death, and throughout as she deals with injured and dying people. Best for older children and up.
