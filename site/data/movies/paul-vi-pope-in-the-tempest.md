### Overview

Good movie that shows the life of Pope Paul VI.

### Review

Generally interesting. only available in Italian, but has English subtitles.

### Caveats

Not suitable for children.

I have absolutely no idea how accurate any of this movie is, and if it's mostly fiction, or rewritten history, then that would be bad at worst, or useless at best.
