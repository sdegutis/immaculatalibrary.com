### Overview

Highly acclaimed silent film about the trial and execution of St. Joan of Arc. All dialogue in the movie is taken from real life court records.

### Review

Excellent instrumental music and cinematography make this a very moving film.

### Caveats

For adults only:

* Extremely intense close-up shots throughout
* Intense psychological torture
* Visual blood letting
* Vivid threat of physical torture
* The sight of a dead woman near the end
* The thorough burning of St. Joan at the stake

It also contains visual breast feeding near the beginning of the execution scene, which parents may want to censor or discuss when watching with their children.
