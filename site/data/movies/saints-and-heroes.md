### Overview

Short episodes containing a summary of the life of each saint. Intended for children but also inspiring for devout adults: a treat for the whole family.

### Review

This collection of kids movies are actually very accurate and faithful to the events and the spirit of each saint, except for the 1980s-style banter and jokes that necessarily had to find their way into each episode.

### Caveats

Family friendly, but a few episodes have a few scary scenes which might be too much for young children. Parents or older siblings should review these scenes first:

* Vision of Hell in the Fatima movie
* Interrogation of children in Fatima movie
* Crocodile scene in St. Francis Xavier movie
* Nightmare scene in St. Patrick movie

Some movies I don't recommend at all:

* Guardian Angel movie is very bad
* St. Nicholas movie is irreverent and strange
* Columbus is not a Saint
* The Odyssey is literally pagan mythology
