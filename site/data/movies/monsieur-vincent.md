### Overview

Biopic of St. Vincent de Paul, of how he founded the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, and his motivations and reflections.

### Review

Very good and inspiring. Seems very accurate.

### Caveats

Overall best for teens and up:

* Brief scenes of gore near middle
* Very mature themes
* Discussion of abandoned and tortured babies
* Some saintly arguing with bad nuns

It also contains visual breast feeding near the middle, which parents may want to censor or discuss when watching with their children.

Also:

* Only in French, with subtitles.
