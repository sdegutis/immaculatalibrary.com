### Overview

Beautifully made film about St. Brother Albert, who gave up a promising career in art in order to personally serve and live among the poor and homeless.

### Review

Based on a play by St. John Paul II, which he called rather an "inner theater" than a drama, the dialogue is richly theological and philosophical. The filmmakers did a wonderful job adapting this to film, aptly calling it not a film but a filmed play.

### Caveats

* *Skip!* Gory amputation (0:07:00 to 0:08:00)
* Intense and potentially confusing monologue
* Homeless man starts a fight

For teenagers and older.
