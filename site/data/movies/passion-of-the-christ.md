### Review

This isn't quite a movie, it's more of a devotion. Don't watch this for entertainment, watch this prayerfully and with humility, and you will grow in love for God.

### Caveats

* Many scenes with Judas have demons
* Many scenes with Judas have jump-scares
* Suicide scene with Judas
* Graphic scourging of Jesus revealing bones
* Creepy scenes with Satan

In general, not appropriate for anyone younger than teenagers.
