### Overview

Intense movie that captures the life and spirit of St. Ignatius of Loyola perfectly. Based very closely on his autobiography and other reliable sources, this film takes very few liberties, and much of the events and dialogue are verbatim.

### Review

The few scenes where the filmmakers had no choice but to guess are very well chosen, and fit the overall spirit of this saint extremely accurately. Overall extremely inspiring and powerful movie.

### Caveats

Not appropriate for anyone younger than older teens!

* Shows disgusting terribly broken leg
* Graphic amputation of broken bone
* Suicide theme at beginning and end
* Prostitution scene near middle
* Visuals of burning at the stake
* Imminent threat of death to pre-Jesuits
* Theme of extreme guilt
* Graphic self-flogging by Ignatius
