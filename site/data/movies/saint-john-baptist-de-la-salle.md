### Overview

Later life of St. John Baptist de la Salle, starting with his founding of schools, through the end of his life, showing his difficulties and persecutions.

### Review

The movie was generally inspiring and enjoyable.

### Caveats

It's generally okay for children, except:

* Scene with hanged men on trees (1:06:00)
* Destruction of school (from 0:48:00 to 0:49:00)

Also, I cannot yet attest to the accuracy of it, since I know very little about his actual life.
