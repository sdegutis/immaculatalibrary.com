### Overview

Movie about St. Maria Soledad who helped the sick at night. Shows her trials and struggles and persevering faith.

### Review

Interesting and inspiring movie.

### Caveats

Contains a few intense emotional scenes, some rough language with a modern day sick man, and young children won't understand any of the movie. Best for older children and above.
