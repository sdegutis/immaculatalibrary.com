### Overview

Touches on the important parts of his early life and character, leading up to his election as Pope John Paul II. Shows the persecutions he went through by the Nazis and Communists in Poland. The second half is about his papacy through his death.

### Review

Interesting, exciting, and inspiring and moving at times.

### Caveats

Not family friendly!

Shows a graphic murder and other violence.

There is one scene in which John Paul II's childhood friend tells a story of how young Karol said that it doesn't matter whether a person is Jewish or Catholic, a conversation which may not have actually happened, and has strong potential to lead to serious and damaging indifferentism in impressionable viewers.

I have absolutely no idea how accurate any of this movie is, and if it's mostly fiction, or rewritten history, then that would be bad at worst, or useless at best.
