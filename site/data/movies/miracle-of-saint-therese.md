### Overview

Good and wholesome family film about the Little Flower, St. Therese of Lisieux. The film admits in the beginning that it has to take certain liberties to get the same point across on screen as the book makes, but that you ought to read the Story of a Soul for the pure facts.

### Review

It does a great job at showing the spirit of this great Saint and Doctor of the Church.

### Caveats

* She's told her mother is dead near the beginning
* An intense dialogue during a storm near the end

Other than this, very family friendly.
