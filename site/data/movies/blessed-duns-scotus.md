### Overview

Touches on some basic points of the life of Blessed John Duns Scotus, including his vocation, his conflicts with the local government, and his theological conflict with the university of Paris over the Immaculate Conception, which is the focus of the last half of this movie.

### Review

Very inspiring and interesting movie about this saint. Very theological throughout. Has a love story intertwined which emphasizes the importance of discernment of vocation. Excellent score, really really great music throughout.

### Caveats

Very family friendly (with a few exceptions below), but young kids will be bored.

* Sudden scourging of Jesus at 16:04
* Potentially confusing philosophical dialogue
