### Overview

The most accurate, beautiful, and moving film about Fatima. Made by independent filmmakers, so it has its strengths and weaknesses.

### Review

Personally my favorite of all Fatima movies, with an especially beautiful miracle scene and general scenes of the Blessed Virgin.

### Caveats

Too intense for young kids.

* General persecution of three children
* Diabolic vision shortly after first apparition
* Vision of Hell and the future
* Intense interrogation
