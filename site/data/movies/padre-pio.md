### Overview

Movie about the more notable aspects of the life of St. Padre Pio. Seems to be accurate, from what we can find in our books and online about this saint.

### Review

Interesting and inspiring movie.

### Caveats

Overall not appropriate for children:

* Padre Pio exorcizes a possessed woman
* He's physically attacked by invisible demons
* A man admits to preparing to commit murder
