### Overview

Touches on the whole life of St. Augustine: his philosophy, search for truth, relationships with his mother St. Monico and local bishop St. Augustine, his gradual conversion, and life as a Bishop, fighting heresies and helping his flock through barbarian raids.

### Review

It's nearly impossible to do St. Augustine's Confessions justice in movie form, but this movie does a surprisingly good job of capturing the thought and heart of this saint, in a basic biographical form. The actor who plays St. Ambrose offers a very powerful performance.

### Caveats

Not very family friendly due to much highly emotional content and some violence.

Several scenes near the beginning are too sensual and not appropriate for most people.
