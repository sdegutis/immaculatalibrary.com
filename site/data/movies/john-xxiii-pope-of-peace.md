### Overview

Interesting and entertaining movie about St. John XXIII, which shows his kind heart, his humility, and his sense of humor. Explains the context of his papacy very well.

### Review

Overall good, and family friendly.

### Caveats

I have absolutely no idea how accurate any of this movie is, and if it's mostly fiction, or rewritten history, then that would be bad at worst, or useless at best.
