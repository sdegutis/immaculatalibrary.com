### Overview

Brief glimpses into the life and spirit of St. Francis of Assisi and the first Franciscans.

### Review

Very good and inspiring. Can't attest to literal accuracy, but seems to capture the spirit of the Saint.

### Caveats

Much of it is not appropriate for younger kids:

* Juniper is beaten and almost executed
* A pig is dismembered

Also:

* It's only in Italian with subtitles
