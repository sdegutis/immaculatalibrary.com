Highly recommended by St. Francis de Sales who read bits of it every day for almost 20 years, this book uncovers many finer points and subtle dangers of the spiritual life. With a specialty on conquering your vices, it gives five distinct methods. Quite structured.

### Which edition should I get?

They're both fine versions, almost identical. In a time when most English copies of this book were translated and printed by Anglicans, the Dornin and Haydock editions are the only two printed and published by Catholics, one in America and the other by an underground Catholic publisher in England.
