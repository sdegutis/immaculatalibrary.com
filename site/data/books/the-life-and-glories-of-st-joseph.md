**Important:** This book does **not** have any explicit approbations. It is included in this library because it seems to be useful. That said, it may contain heretical opinions. Be careful when reading it, and especially compare it with the other books in this library, which take precedence in authority over this book, since the other St. Joseph books here *do* have approbations.

*Note:* This book has two editions, because the first edition is generally a better quality scan, and does not have the restrictions of Google Books scans. But the second edition is 3 years newer, and we are not sure what the differences between the two editions are. Therefore both are included, for you to decide which to read.
