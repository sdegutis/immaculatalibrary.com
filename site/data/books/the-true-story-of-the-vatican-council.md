This work has no approbations, but is by Henry Edward Cardinal Manning, who was very zealous in Catholic doctrine, having converted from Anglicanism to Catholicism along with St. John Henry Edward Manning. That said, this book may contain opinions of his which are not necessarily doctrines of the Catholic Church. It is included in this library because of its historical and theological interest.
