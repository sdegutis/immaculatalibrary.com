  This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat
  manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.

> **Aug.** That we who cannot obtain eternal life of ourselves, might live by the eating that bread, He descended from heaven: *This is the bread which cometh down from heaven*.
> 
> **Hilary.** He calls Himself the bread, because He is the origin of His own body. And lest it should be thought that the virtue and nature of the Word had given way to the flesh, He calls the bread His flesh, that, inasmuch as the bread came down from heaven, it might be seen that His body was not of human conception, but a heavenly body. To say that the bread is His own, is to declare that the Word assumed His body Himself.
> 
> **Theophyl.** For we do not eat God simply, God being impalpable and incorporeal; nor again, the flesh of man simply, which would not profit us. But God having taken flesh into union with Himself, that flesh is quickening. Not that it has changed its own for the Divine nature; but, just as heated iron remains iron, with the action of the heat in it; so our Lord's flesh is quickening, as being the flesh of the Word of God.

> **Bede.** And to shew the wide interval between the shadow and the light, the type and the reality, He adds, *Not an your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever*.
> 
> **Aug.** The death here meant is death eternal. For even those who eat Christ are subject to natural death; but they live for ever, because Christ is everlasting life.

> **Chrys.** For if it was possible without harvest or fruit of the earth, or any such thing, to preserve the lives of the Israelites of old for forty years, much more will He be able to do this with that spiritual food, of which the manna is the type. He knew how precious a thing life was in men's eyes, and therefore repeats His promise of life often; just as the Old Testament had done; only that it only offered length of life, He life without end. This promise was an abolition of that sentence of death, which sin had brought upon us.
