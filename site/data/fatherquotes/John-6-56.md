gospelQuote: He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.

> **Aug.** Then He explains what it is to eat His body and drink His blood: *He that eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, dwelleth in Me, and I in him*. So then to partake of that meat and that drink, is to dwell in Christ and Christ in thee.
> 
> He that dwelleth not in Christ, and in whom Christ dwelleth not, neither eateth His flesh, nor drinketh His blood: but rather eateth and drinketh the sacrament of it to his own damnation.
> 
> **Chrys.** Or, having given a promise of eternal life to those that eat Him, He says this to confirm it: *He that eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, dwelleth in Me, and I in him.*
> 
> **Aug.** As for those, as indeed there are many, who either eat that flesh and drink that blood hypocritically, or, who having eaten, become apostates, do they dwell in Christ, and Christ in them? Nay, but there is a certain mode of eating that flesh, and drinking that blood, in the which he that eateth and drinketh, dwelleth in Christ, and Christ in him.
> 
> **Aug.** That is to say, such an one eateth the body and drinketh the blood of Christ not in the sacramental sense, but in reality.
