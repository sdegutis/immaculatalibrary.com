gospelQuote: For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
---

> **Bede.** He had said above, *Whoso eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life*: and now to shew the great difference between bodily meat and drink, and the spiritual mystery of His body and blood, He adds, *For My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed.*
> 
> **Chrys.** i. e. this is no enigma, or parable, but ye must really eat the body of Christ; or He means to say that the true meat was He who saved the soul.
> 
> **Aug.** Or thus: Whereas men desire meat and drink to satisfy hunger and thirst, this effect is only really produced by that meat and drink, which makes the receivers of it immortal and incorruptible; i. e. the society of Saints, where is peace and unity, full and perfect.

> On which account our Lord has chosen for the types of His body and blood, things which become one out of many. Bread is a quantity of grains united into one mass, wine a quantity of grapes squeezed together.
