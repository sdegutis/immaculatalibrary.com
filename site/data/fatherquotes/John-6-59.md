gospelQuote: These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
---

> **Chrys.** *These things said He in the synagogue, as He taught in Capernaum*; where many displays of His power took place. He taught in the synagogue and in the temple, with the view of attracting the multitude, and as a sign that He was not acting in opposition to the Father.
> 
> **Bede.** Mystically, Capernaum, which means beautiful town, stands for the world: the synagogue, for the Jewish people. The meaning is, that our Lord hath, by the mystery of the incarnation, manifested Himself to the world, and also taught the Jewish people His doctrines.
