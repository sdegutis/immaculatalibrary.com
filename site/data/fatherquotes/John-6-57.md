gospelQuote: >-
  As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth
  me, even he shall live by me.

> **Chrys.** And because I live, it is manifest that he will live also: *As the living Father hath sent Me, and I live by the Father, even so he that eateth Me, even he shall live by Me.* As if He said, As the Father liveth, so do I live; adding, lest you should think Him unbegotten, *By the Father*, meaning that He has His source in the Father. *He that eateth Me, even he shall live by me*; the life here meant is not life simply, but the justified life: for even unbelievers live, who never eat of that flesh at all. Nor is it of the general resurrection He speaks, (for all will rise again,) but of the resurrection to glory, and reward.

> **Aug.** He saith not, As I eat the Father, and live by the Father, so he that eateth Me, even he shall live by Me.
> 
> For the Son does not grow better by partaking of the Father, as we do by partaking of the Son, i. e. of His one body and blood, which this eating and drinking signifies.
> 
> So that His saying, *I live by the Father*, because He is from Him, must not be understood as detracting from His equality.
> 
> Nor do the words, *Even he that eateth Me, the same shall live by Me*, give us the equality that He has. He does not equalize, but only mediates between God and man.
> 
> If, however, we understand the words, *I live by the Father*, in the sense of those below, *My Father is greater than I*, then it is as if He said, That I live by the Father, i. e. refer my life to Him, as my superior, my humiliation in my incarnation is the cause; but He who lives by Me, lives by Me by virtue of partaking of My flesh.

> **Hilary.** Of the truth then of the body and blood of Christ, no room for doubting remain : for, by the declaration of our Lord Himself, and by the teaching of our own faith, the flesh is really flesh, and the blood really blood.
> 
> This then is our principle of life. While we are in the flesh, Christ dwelleth in us by His flesh. And we shall live by Him, according as He liveth. If then we live naturally by partaking of Him according to the flesh, He also liveth naturally by the indwelling of the Father according to the Spirit. His birth did not give Him an alien or different nature from the Father.
