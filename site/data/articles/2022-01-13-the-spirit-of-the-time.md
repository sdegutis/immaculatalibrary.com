I appeal to you, do not read Catholic news. It is very much not good for you. And avoid listening to those who call themselves Traditional Catholics, to their commentary on Catholic news and events.

Whatever we consume, we are filled with that spirit. When our parents repeat something enough, then when we grow up, we hear those thoughts in our own heads as if they were our own. They have passed on their spirits to us.

By spirit, I don't mean soul. I mean, the core principles that you use when deciding what to think, say, and do. This is a *very* delicte thing within us, and it's *very* easy to absorb part of someone else's spirit.

What do we see in Catholic news? Lots of complaining, lots of bitterness, tons of accusations, fear, strife, suspicion, and an overall general spirit of despair and hopelessness.

This is also the spirit we often see in Traditional Catholics. They complain, this and that Bishop did wrong, this priest should have done this, the Pope should not have done that.

Why? At their core, they are saying, "if only those in charge would actually stop bad things from happening, my life would be better, and I could finally be happy."

This is not the spirit of St. Peter, who said, "why are you surprised at the fiery ordeal which comes upon you to prove you, as though something strange were happening to you?"

Further, look at what St. Paul says:

> I appeal to you, brethren, to take note of those who create dissensions and difficulties, in opposition to the doctrine which you have been taught; avoid them. (Romans 16:17)

> I appeal to you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree and that there be no dissensions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment. (1 Corinthians 1:10)

> But avoid stupid controversies, genealogies, dissensions, and quarrels over the law, for they are unprofitable and futile. (Titus 3:9)

> Avoid the godless chatter and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge, for by professing it some have missed the mark as regards the faith. (1 Timothy 6:20-21)

> For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh, and behaving like ordinary men? (1 Corinthians 3:3)

Does this all sound familiar? Avoid those who are wolves in sheep's clothing, who fit these descriptions of St. Paul. Avoid these things knowing that the Holy Spirit Himself commanded you to, through St. Paul!

Whatever content you read or watch or listen to, you are filled with the spirit that was imbued in it when it was created. Whatever conversation you listen to, you will be filled with the spirit of those who communicate with you.

This is why I strongly recommend listening to the Audio Bible. You will be filled with the spirit that is behind it. And what spirit is that, except the Holy Spirit Himself? This is one of the best things I think you can do for your soul. It's a way to actually and truly read the Bible, while keeping busy with our daily life!

This is also why I post daily Book Snippets. Who wrote these books? They were mostly Saints! And those who weren't, their books were *approved* by Saints, and *read* by Saints, and helped to *make* them Saints!

So I encourage you, stick to what is true and approved.

You might ask, what if something important happens? Trust me, if it's *really that important* for your life, then God will make sure you find out somehow, if you are always striving to do God's will, and if knowing this "important news" would be helpful for your salvation and not harmful to it.
