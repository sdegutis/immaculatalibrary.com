title: The character of St. Joseph
---

If Jesus didn't have the highly specific mission of saving us from our sins by dying on the cross, which inherently required him to do everything he did beforehand in just the order he did it in, he would have been exactly like Joseph. Or rather, Joseph was exactly like Jesus, only different because of circumstances.

In the same way, if God the Father could have became man and died on the cross to save us from our sins, he would have been exactly like Jesus. This is why Jesus says the Philip, if you have seen the Father, you have seen me. Not that Jesus is the Father as some modern heretics think, but that the Father and the Son are so absolutely united in heart and mind and judgment that they would have done the same thing as one another in any given circumstance.

So to know more about St. Joseph, just think about what Jesus would have done, had he been married, had he needed to migrate to Egypt to protect his children, had he needed to establish a long term career for himself in a foreign country. Jesus was fearless in the face of criminals and corruption, tirelessly helped the poor and needy, and always did whatever was right, no matter what it cost him.
