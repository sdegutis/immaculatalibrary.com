When you feel like you can't handle any more of the difficulties God is putting in your life, don't despair. Jesus is going to rescue you from it soon. Here are some of the promises from the Bible to comfort and reassure you:

2 Timothy 4:18:

> The Lord will rescue me from every evil and save me for his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.

2 Corinthians 1:3-7

> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
>
> For as we share abundantly in Christ's sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too.
>
> If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; and if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer.
>
> Our hope for you is unshaken; for we know that as you share in our sufferings, you will also share in our comfort.

1 Peter 5:6-11:

> Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that in due time he may exalt you.
>
> Cast all your anxieties on him, for he cares about you.
>
> Be sober, be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking some one to devour.
>
> Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experience of suffering is required of your brotherhood throughout the world.
>
> And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, establish, and strengthen you.

1 Peter 3:13-14:

> Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is right?
>
> But even if you do suffer for righteousness' sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, but in your hearts reverence Christ as Lord.

Matthew 10:26-33:

> So have no fear of them; for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known.
>
> What I tell you in the dark, utter in the light; and what you hear whispered, proclaim upon the housetops.
>
> And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
>
> Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father's will.
>
> But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.
>
> So every one who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven; but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven.

Hebrews 12:3-13:

> Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted.
>
> In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. And have you forgotten the exhortation which addresses you as sons?---
>
>> "My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor lose courage when you are punished by him. For the Lord disciplines him whom he loves,
and chastises every son whom he receives."
>
> It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?
>
> If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.
>
> Besides this, we have had earthly fathers to discipline us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live?
>
> For they disciplined us for a short time at their pleasure, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness.
>
> For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant; later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.
>
> Therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees, and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather be healed.

Matthew 5:3-12:

> Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
>
> Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
>
> Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
>
> Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
>
> Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
>
> Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
>
> Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
>
> Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
>
> Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so men persecuted the prophets who were before you.

Colossians 1:11-14:

> May you be strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, for all endurance and patience with joy, giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in light.
>
> He has delivered us from the dominion of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.

Hebrews 6:13-20:

> For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself, saying, "Surely I will bless you and multiply you." And thus Abraham, having patiently endured, obtained the promise.
>
> Men indeed swear by a greater than themselves, and in all their disputes an oath is final for confirmation. So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he interposed with an oath, so that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible that God should prove false, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to seize the hope set before us.
>
> We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner shrine behind the curtain, where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.

Revelation 3:7-13:

> And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write:
>
>> The words of the holy one, the true one, who has the key of David, who opens and no one shall shut, who shuts and no one opens.
>>
>> I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut;
>>
>> I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.
>>
>> Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie---behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet, and learn that I have loved you.
>>
>> Because you have kept my word of patient endurance, I will keep you from the hour of trial which is coming on the whole world, to try those who dwell upon the earth.
>>
>> I am coming soon; hold fast what you have, so that no one may seize your crown.
>>
>> He who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God; never shall he go out of it, and I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem which comes down from my God out of heaven, and my own new name.
>>
>> He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.


Revelation 21:3-4:

> And I heard a great voice from the throne saying, "Behold, the dwelling of God is with men. He will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself will be with them; he will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain any more, for the former things have passed away."

Revelation 22:1-7:

> Then he showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
>
> There shall no more be anything accursed, but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall worship him; they shall see his face, and his name shall be on their foreheads.
>
> And night shall be no more; they need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they shall reign for ever and ever.
>
> And he said to me, "These words are trustworthy and true. And the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his servants what must soon take place. And behold, I am coming soon."

Revelation 22:20-21, the very last words of the Bible:

> He who testifies to these things says, "Surely I am coming soon."
>
> Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!
>
> The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen.
