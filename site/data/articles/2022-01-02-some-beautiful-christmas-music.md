I know you like beautiful music. Here is some of the most beautiful I've ever heard. Possibly the closest thing on earth to hearing the angels sing.

They're all sung by the amazing choir of [the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception](https://www.nationalshrine.org/).

* [Noel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuIwAfHyPDw&t=4863s) sung beautifully during Holy Communion on Christmas Day 2021

* [Of the Father's Heart Begotten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuIwAfHyPDw&t=5252s) (a hymn I never heard before) sung immediately after that Noel in the same Mass

* [The Angel Gabriel from Heaven Came](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfA-Mr0aVoo&t=1907s) sung during Christmas Eve Mass on 2018, very beautifully. I never heard of this carol before.

* [O Holy Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GsZYlPrkXw&t=7745s) sung during Christmas Eve Mass in 2019

* [We Three Kings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P19UtVOBOxo&t=3262s) from this year's Christmas Concert by this amazing choir

* [Mary's Magnificat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ze5fxkUcpbc&t=1100s) from 2017's Christmas Eve concert, so beautiful

* [King of Glory, King of Peace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ze5fxkUcpbc&t=1959s) sung just before Christmas Eve Mass began in 2017. I've never heard of this one either. After a few listens, it grew on me, and it's now one of my favorite. At least, this rendition.

* [2017 Christmas Eve mashup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1462&v=ze5fxkUcpbc&feature=youtu.be), very beautiful and impressive, which includes these songs:
  * God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen
  * Noel
  * Good Christian Friends, Rejoice
  * Come ye lofty, come ye lowly

Here's the lyrics in case you want to learn these songs like I do:

<details>
<summary><b>Noel</b></summary>

> The First Noel, the Angels did say  
> Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay  
> In fields where they lay keeping their sheep  
> On a cold winter's night that was so deep.  
> Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
> Born is the King of Israel!  
>   
> They looked up and saw a star  
> Shining in the East beyond them far  
> And to the earth it gave great light  
> And so it continued both day and night.  
> Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
> Born is the King of Israel!  
>   
> And by the light of that same star  
> Three Wise men came from country far  
> To seek for a King was their intent  
> And to follow the star wherever it went.  
> Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
> Born is the King of Israel!  
>   
> This star drew nigh to the northwest  
> O'er Bethlehem it took its rest  
> And there it did both pause and stay  
> Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.  
> Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
> Born is the King of Israel!  
>   
> Then entered in those Wise men three  
> Full reverently upon their knee  
> And offered there in His presence  
> Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.  
> Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
> Born is the King of Israel!   
>   
> Then let us all with one accord  
> Sing praises to our heavenly Lord  
> That hath made Heaven and earth of nought  
> And with his blood mankind has bought.  
> Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
> Born is the King of Israel!

<summary><b>Of the Father's Heart Begotten</b></summary>

> Of the Father’s heart begotten,   
> Ere the world from chaos rose,   
> He is Alpha: from that Fountain   
> All that is and hath been flows;  
> He is Omega, of all things   
> Yet to come the mystic Close,  
> Evermore and evermore.   
>   
> By his word was all created;   
> He commanded and ‘twas done;  
> Earth and sky and boundless ocean,   
> Universe of three in one,  
> All that sees the moon’s soft radiance,   
> All that breathes beneath the sun,  
> Evermore and evermore.   
>   
> He assumed this mortal body,   
> Frail and feeble, doomed to die,   
> That the race from dust created   
> Might not perish utterly,  
> Which the dreadful Law had sentenced   
> In the depths of hell to lie,  
> Evermore and evermore.  
>   
> O How blest that wondrous birthday,   
> When the Maid the curse retrieved,  
> Brought to birth mankind’s salvation,   
> By the Holy Ghost conceived;  
> And the Bade, the world’s Redeemer,   
> In her loving arms received,  
> Evermore and evermore.  
>   
> This is he, whom seer and sibyl   
> Sang in ages long gone by;  
> This is he of old revealed   
> In the page of prophecy;   
> Lo! he comes, the promised Savior;   
> Let the world his praises cry!  
> Evermore and evermore.  
>   
> Sing, ye heights of heav’n, his praises;   
> Angels and Archangels, sing!  
> Wheresoe’er ye be, ye faithful,   
> Let your joyous anthems ring,  
> Ev’ry tongue his name confessing,   
> Countless voices answering,  
> Evermore and evermore

<summary><b>The Angel Gabriel From Heaven Came</b></summary>


> The angel Gabriel from heaven came  
> His wings as drifted snow his eyes as flame  
> "All hail" said he "thou lowly maiden Mary,  
> Most highly favored lady," Gloria!  
>   
> "For know a blessed mother thou shalt be,  
> All generations laud and honor thee,  
> Thy Son shall be Emanuel, by seers foretold  
> Most highly favored lady," Gloria!  
>   
> Then gentle Mary meekly bowed her head  
> "To me be as it pleaseth God," she said,  
> "My soul shall laud and magnify his holy name."  
> Most highly favored lady. Gloria!  
>   
> Of her, Emanuel, the Christ was born  
> In Bethlehem, all on a Christmas morn  
> And Christian folk throughout the world will ever say:  
> "Most highly favored lady," Gloria!

<summary><b>O Holy Night</b></summary>

> O holy night, the stars are brightly shining,  
> It is the night of the dear Saviour’s birth;  
> Long lay the world in sin and error pining,  
> 'Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth.  
> A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,  
> For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn;  
>   
> Fall on your knees,  
> Oh hear the angel voices!  
> O night divine!  
> O night when Christ was born.  
> O night divine,  
> O night, O night divine.  
>   
> Led by the light of Faith serenely beaming;  
> With glowing hearts by his cradle we stand:  
> So, led by light of a star sweetly gleaming,  
> Here came the wise men from the Orient land,  
> The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger,  
> In all our trials born to be our friend;  
>   
> He knows our need, To our weakness no stranger!  
> Behold your King! Before Him lowly bend!  
> Behold your King! your King! before him bend!  
>   
> Truly He taught us to love one another;  
> His law is Love and His gospel is Peace;  
> Chains shall he break, for the slave is our brother,  
> And in his name all oppression shall cease,  
> Sweet hymns of joy in grateful Chorus raise we;  
> Let all within us praise his Holy name!  
>   
> Christ is the Lord, then ever and ever praise we!  
> His pow'r and glory, evermore proclaim!  
> His pow'r and glory, evermore proclaim!

And when you're done listening to those songs, if you still want more, this same choir sung this [1 hour Christmas Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P19UtVOBOxo) just a week ago. It's great to put on in the background.
