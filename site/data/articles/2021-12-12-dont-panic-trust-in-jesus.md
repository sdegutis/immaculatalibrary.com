Jesus said, "Let not your hearts be troubled." And not just once, but twice in a row.

Then he said, "I have said all this to keep you from falling away."

He knew bad things were going to happen to us. He said it would.

But he also *conquered* those bad things, and *earned the right* to save us from them.

So if we stick close to Jesus, he will rescue us from it all. And soon!
