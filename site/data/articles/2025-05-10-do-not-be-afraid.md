title: Do not be afraid
---

When Jesus walked on water, his disciples were afraid, because they thought he was a ghost!

They were rowing their boat all night, but didn't get far, because the wind was strong, and was making big waves.

The word for "wind" is the same as "spirit" in older languages. So the strong wind like was bad spirits, also called demons.

The big waves were like the many problems of life that make it so hard to do anything good in life. Demons like to cause these problems.

Jesus walked on water! He was not swimming, or drowning, or running, or working hard to walk through the waves. He walked calmly, but he was still able to get farther than the boat!

The problems of life did not hold him back. They did not stop him. He was still able to do good, no matter how many problems happened.

In fact, the waves probably made it *easier* for him to walk forward, becoming a kind of sideways staircase for him to walk on!

I think so because problems never made things *harder* for Jesus to do good, but *easier*. How could he heal someone unless they were sick? And how could he save us from our sins unless he died on the cross?

He did not need to die on the cross to save us, but it was the best way. By letting bad things happen to him, he *proved* to us that he loves us.

When bad things happen to us, God does not just say "I hope things get better for you" or "I'm sorry bad things are happening to you."

No. He *joins us* in suffering, feeling pain, experiencing sadness and loneliness, in being hated by all, betrayed by even his closest friends.

When the disciples saw Jesus, they thought he was a ghost! The word for "ghost" and "spirit" are the same in older languages. The disciples thought he was the one *causing* the problems! But he was only there to *solve* the problems, and only because there *were* problems.

Jesus is the *savior*. He saves us from drowning in our problems. He helps us to walk *on top of* our problems. And he always shows up *in* the problems. When problems come, Jesus is there, promising us that he will help us.

When bad things happen to you, remember these quotes from the Bible:

"Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you." (James 4:7)

"With every temptation, God will give you a way to escape it." (1 Corinthians 10:13)

"Count it as a good thing and rejoice when bad things happen to you." (James 1:2)

"When bad people persecute you and lie about you whenever you do good, rejoice and leap for joy!" (Jesus in Luke 6:23)

"Do not be surprised when bad things happen to you, just like they happen to every Christian." (1 Peter 4:12)

"Is a servant greater than the master? If bad things happened to me, bad things must also happen to you. But don't let your hearts be troubled or afraid." (Jesus in John 14:1, John 14:27, John 13:15-16, and John 15:20)

"The Lord is my helper. I will not be afraid." (Hebrews 13:6)

"He was not blind because he sinned or his parents sinned, but only to prove the glory of God." (Jesus in John 9:3)

"Now my soul is troubled. And what shall I say, father save me from this hour? No! I came *for* this hour. Father, glorify your name!" (Jesus in John 12:27)

"My soul is sad enough that I could die from it. Abba, father, you can do anything. If it be possible, take this cup from me. But let your will be done, not my will!" (Jesus in Matthew 26:39 and Mark 14:36)

"God is treating you as sons. For what son is there who does not get disciplined? He disciplines you because he *accepts* you as a son. If you were *not* disciplined, it would be because you are *not* his son." (Hebrews 12:7-13)

"God lets bad things happen to you to purify your faith just like fire purifies gold, and your faith is more precious than gold." (1 Peter 1:7)
