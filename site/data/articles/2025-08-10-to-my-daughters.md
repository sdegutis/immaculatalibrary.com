title: To my daughters...
---

It's me, your dad. I am writing this to you because I love you, my daughters, and I want to say a few more things to you. I told you most of these things already, but I want to make sure you can remember them better for later.

I trust that God will help me, and I know God will help you. Always trust in God and carry your cross. Never forget what I taught you: you know you are following the real Jesus if you are carrying your cross.

You make me so very happy. I am so proud of you both. The last two years with you have been so wonderful and good. I am so glad that I got to spend all of that time with you. I had so much fun playing Saint Game with you, and To Eat or Not To Eat, and Uno, and Kirby, and all the other games we played.

I told you yesterday that the most important thing to me is that you are good. If you are good, then I am happy. So always be good girls. Promise me that you will always be good girls. Try to never commit even one single mortal sin. But if you do, then tell God you're sorry right away, and go to Confession as soon as you can. Trust him that he loves you. Sometimes he lets you fall into sins to teach you a lesson.

For the past few weeks, we have talked about God a lot, and I was very surprised about how much you have both learned. You answered all my questions about God and Mary and the Saints very well! I am very happy and very proud of you both!

Don't forget to do your prayers every day. Do an Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be every day. Do them all in the morning, at noon, and at night. If you do your whole Rosary, then you can skip one of those prayers and do the Rosary at that time instead.

Always read the Bible, a little of it every day. And read the red book I gave you, and when you're older, read your Catechism. It will help you to understand the Bible better. Some things in it can be confusing.

Practice sharing and making little sacrifices. In the moment it is hard, but later it will help you a lot. You will have a much happier life if you learn to do this now. Especially practice sharing when playing your imagination games with each other. Take turns and be fair, don't be selfish and rude, and let your sister help you make a fair part of the game.

Do not go on TikTok or YouTube or watch any other videos like that. They will quickly make your life very, very bad. You won't understand why, but you have to trust me on this. Watch holy movies and saint movies. Read the lives of the saints and the Bible. This will be enough to make you happy and not bored.

Don't listen to bad music. Some music doesn't seem bad at first, but it will make you think that some bad things are not bad. And some bad music will make you not like to read the Bible anymore. Avoid bad music. If any music seems like the Blessed Virgin Mary would not have liked it, then don't listen to it!

Keep practicing piano. You are both getting so very good at it! Keep working hard at it. Did you notice how you got so much better than in the beginning? It's because you worked hard little by little. Good job! Keep doing that and you will be very great at it one day!

Always work hard to earn your rewards, like you did when we were here together. Never let anyone give you free rewards, because that is a sin, and God will make sure you pay for it later.

Remember everything that I taught you about right and wrong, and don't do wrong. Me and most people that I know have done wrong for most of our lives, and our lives are filled with problems because of it. I don't want your life to be filled with the same sad problems.

It's okay to have problems in life when you are doing good and have a good heart. Then you are earning tickets to Heaven for yourselves and for other people. But if you do bad and have problems, it's much more sad, even though you can still get to Heaven if you're really truly sorry. That is the path I took. I want you to have a much happier path to Heaven.

Always try to be like Mary. I told you before that every girl should be like Mary and every man should be like Joseph, and every child should be like the child Jesus. Don't forget this. Read your Bible and the Saints, and you will get a clue about how Jesus was as a kid, and how Mary and Joseph are.

Don't be tricked by people who say they have shortcuts to happiness, or shortcuts to God, or shortcuts to money, or shortcuts to anything. Follow God and carry your cross, and God will help you to have everything you need. Be like Mary.

Our life is changing a little right now. That keeps happening. That's part of life. Life changes. It happened to the Saints too, don't forget that. Try to play Saint Game every day.

Don't read the Gospel by Gen Z. I do not like that book anymore. I only wrote it so I could have money. But I don't think very many good things came from that book. Many people liked it, but it didn't help them to become Catholic or receive more Sacraments. So I don't think it was a good book. Just ignore that book.

I love you so much, and I am praying for you every day. Obey your mom and do what she tells you, just like you obeyed me. If you disobey her, you will make me sad. She is trying so hard to be a good mom, but it is difficult to have lots of children and take care of them all. Obey her, to make her life easier.

Don't forget your brown scapular. Mary will deliver you from purgatory if you wear it and keep your heart pure and clean, and don't let evil love into your heart. Most people let evil love into their heart, and God punishes them by giving them a very bad life. Please don't let that happen to you. Keep your heart pure, both of you, for my sake.

Later you will probably learn about the wrongs I did, and the wrongs others did against me. Please forgive me because my past mistakes are making your life harder. And don't hate other people for the wrong they have done to you or to me. Everyone makes mistakes. Forgive everyone, like Jesus forgives us, saying "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do." Don't ever hate anyone.

Trust me when I say that I love you both, my daughters, and that I love God. You both helped me to love God even more, by being good girls. You helped me. Thank you so much for that. May God bless you for it!

Remember that if you sin, you will make your life more sad, and if you do good, you will make your life more happy. Sometimes bad things happen to you if you do good, but God gives you joy in your heart. Sometimes good things happen to you when you are bad, but God takes away your peace until you become sorry.
