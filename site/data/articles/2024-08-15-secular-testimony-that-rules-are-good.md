title: Secular testimony that rules are good

[Dan Wallach](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-wallach-a712) of the US Defense agency DARPA said in [this article](https://thenewstack.io/can-darpas-tractor-pull-c-to-rust-for-memory-safe-overhaul/):

> “Rust forces the programmer to get things right,” Wallach said in a statement. “It can feel constraining to deal with all the rules it forces, but when you acclimate to them, the rules give you freedom. They’re like guardrails; once you realize they’re there to protect you, you’ll become free to focus on more important things.”

This is exactly a perfect analogy of the moral law of God. It's not rules to constrain us, but a safety net to protect us.
