title: The crucifix
---

Jesus remains on the cross. People love to say, "why do you wear a crucifix or have a picture of one? Jesus is no longer on the cross!"

He is. The Body of Christ is the Church, and Jesus tells the Church, if you would be my disciple, you must carry your cross *daily* and follow me. Jesus is still being crucified in his mystical body.

Anyone who hates the crucifix only hates it because it represents the moral responsibility we each have to carry our own crosses and to bear one another's burdens.
