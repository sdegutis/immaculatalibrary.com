God loves you, far more than you know.

He didn't have to die such a terrible death on the cross. It's true that sin did this to him.

But he *let it* happen. He had no other way to convince us *just how much he loves us.*

And he did it for *each* of us. He loves *each* of us. He died for each of us *personally.*

You *have to* trust in this. It will transform you. It will give you *complete peace.*

It's hard to explain. You have to think about it, meditate on it, contemplate it.
