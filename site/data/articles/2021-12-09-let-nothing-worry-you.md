These words of Mary to St. Juan Diego in 1531 were meant for all of us also:

> Remember this, my littlest son:
>
> Let nothing worry you.
>
> Do not fear this illness, or any problem.
>
> Am I not here, the one who is your Mother?
>
> Don't I bring you joy?
>
> Won't I protect you?
>
> Do you need anything more?

That version was taken from *Juan Diego: Messenger of Guadalupe* ([watch on FORMED](https://watch.formed.org/the-saints-and-heroes-collection/season:1/videos/juan-diego-messenger-of-guadalupe)). The full version from [the official book](http://localhost:8080/books/holy-mary-of-guadalupe.html) is:

> Hear, my son, what I now say to thee: let nothing trouble or afflict thee.
>
> Fear neither pain nor sickness nor other grievous accident. Am not I here, I who am thy Mother?
>
> Thou art beneath my shadow and protection. And am not I life and health?
>
> In my lap art thou, and counted as mine. What more dost thou need?
>
> Have neither sorrow nor anxiety on account of thy uncle's sickness, for he will not die of this attack. Be even assured that he is already well.
