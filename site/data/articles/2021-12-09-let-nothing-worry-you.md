These words of Mary to St. Juan Diego in 1531 were meant for all of us also:

> Remember this, my littlest son:
>
> Let nothing worry you.
>
> Do not fear this illness, or any problem.
>
> Am I not here, the one who is your Mother?
>
> Don't I bring you joy?
>
> Won't I protect you?
>
> Do you need anything more?

Since I can't find an original source of this quote anywhere on the internet, but only a bunch with slight variations, I used the quote from the kids movie *Juan Diego: Messenger of Guadalupe* ([watch on FORMED](https://watch.formed.org/the-saints-and-heroes-collection/season:1/videos/juan-diego-messenger-of-guadalupe)), which is the simplest of them all.

Although it's a kids movie, it is *very* inspiring, and seems extremely accurate (for an adaptation) from what I've researched. I highly recommend watching it today.

Trust in the love and power of our Mother Mary, just as St. Juan Diego did! She will help us. Trust her.
