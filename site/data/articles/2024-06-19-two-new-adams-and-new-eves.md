title: Two new Adams and new Eves

Pontius Pilate had the opportunity to be the new Adam, and Caiaphas to be the new Eve.

Caiaphas committed the sin of wanting to make paradise on earth by taking the place of God, redefining truth, and condemning the actual truth as evil. He then committed the next sin of Eve which was to persuade Adam with violence, hatred, and intensity, to follow her and adopt her definition of truth and paradise over God's, which was why he condemned Jesus to Pontius Pilate.

Pontius Pilate was apathetic to what the truth was, and what route of goodness to take. He just wanted a peaceful and quiet life. Like Adam, he received from God the due and proper instructions about Justice and what is good and evil. And he genuinely tried to peruade Caiaphas to go along with it because it was just. But like Adam, he did not forcefully stand on Truth and Justice, and he valued earthly peace more than the spiritual peace of a clear conscience. This is why he had his wife live with him against Roman law. This signifies that Eve was too close to Adam's heart, closer than God was. Therefore, when Caiaphas insisted that he would have Pontius Pilate executed for treason against Caesar, Pilate finally yielded to injustice, just like Adam did when Eve threatened to destroy his paradise.

But Jesus was the successful new Adam who stood on God's word at all costs. And unlike Adam, he put God above the new Eve, who was Mary. He loved Mary, but he loved God more. And if Mary would have asked him to disobey God's morals, Jesus would have stood by God and not Mary. But Mary put God first also, and did not ask Jesus to come down from the cross. She understood that it was the best way, and that God must come before all else.

The first and greatest commandment is *hear*. Hear what God said to Adam. Hear what God says to humanity. Put God above all else. Value his Truth and Grace above all else, even more than your own life.

It seems strange to call Caiaphas the new Eve since she was female and he was male. It seems to me that both the civil and religious governments come from Adam who had charge of both personally.

Caiaphas was in charge of Israel, who represents the Church, which is mystically the Bride of Christ. And our souls are also referred to mystically as female by all Catholic theologians and Doctors and Fathers, probably because it's part of the Body of Christ and therefore the Bride of Christ. And we know Eve was taken from the body of Adam, so it stands to reason that Eve was part of the Body of Christ.

From this, the division of heart and head also make sense, as Adam was the head of Eve, and Eve was taken from the rib of Adam and therefore represents his heart. So civil government represents the head, and the head is in control of the government. Which explains why historically, governments have been led by men. And religious government represents the heart of the soul, or rather governs the spirit of the soul. Which has ties to the fact that Mary is the highest pinnacle of the Saints, and the fact that the Holy Spirit was her spouse. So religion is governed by the heart, and humanity by the head. This also shows why the men of Israel who followed God at first, but who married pagan women, almost always adopted his wife's god.

Maybe one conclusion that can be drawn from this, is that men need to stand on God's word and not be swayed by the false paradise of women. This would call for a great many men to live a monastic life, free from all worldly desires, free from all social influences that Eve has mastery over, and free to follow God purely and simply as St. Paul did and recommended we do. And the few men who are called to marriage, should wait until they are in their 20s or 30s, and even then, should carefully discern a woman's character for a few months, before proposing to her, to make sure that she will not sway him with the lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, or pride of life. All evil people eventually show their true character in subtle but real and recognizable ways, given enough time.

Another conclusion, certainly less likely to be received well today, could be that men who genuinely try to follow God are inherently gifted with more innate grace to run governments than men who don't or than women who do.

The inverse conclusion is that men in the Church will not be holy unless their heart is led truly and purely by the Holy Spirit, which is especially possible with deep and true devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, and barely possible without it, since she is the Heart of the Church.
