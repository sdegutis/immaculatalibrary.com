Have you ever wondered, how Jesus could say "today you will be with me in Paradise" to the Good Thief (St. Dismas)? Jesus was going to Hell on that day, and will only be Resurrected on Sunday morning. So how could St. Dismas be with Jesus in Paradise on Good Friday? Here's my answer:

Paradise isn't Heaven, Paradise is being with Jesus.

Imagine Heaven without anyone in it, even without God in it. Completely barren, void, empty, lonely, deserted, desolate. That would almost be like another Hell!

Besides that, the devil even goes up to heaven right now (see Job chapter 1), and he will continue to until he, and death, and hell, are thrown into the eternal lake of fire (see the Revelation to St. John).

So Heaven is not *in itself* a paradise. But it's *being with God* that is Paradise. And what else does "being with God" mean than being *at peace* with God? In union? In friendship?

This is why all those who do not know God are never at peace, no matter how many riches and pleasures and honors they acquire in this life. Because *God is the only source of peace and happiness*.

Which means, St. Dismas ("the Good Thief") was in Paradise *even while on the cross!* Even before he died! How? Because he was *at peace* with Jesus finally.

If you want to be in Paradise, it can start *now*, even in *this* life. Just simply *be at peace with Jesus*.

The first step is to *not be in mortal sin*, which is another way of saying try not to *displease* Jesus. But after that, try to go above and beyond, by making sure that each thing you do *is pleasing* to Jesus. Or put in another way: *choose* to do the things that you think *would* please Jesus.

And one of the best ways to be *with* Jesus is to *physically* be with Jesus. Either in Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, or even better, in receiving Holy Communion if you can! Each day, if possible!

The more you *want* to and *try* to make Jesus happy with everything you do, everything you think, and everything you love, the more you will be in a Paradise on Earth.
