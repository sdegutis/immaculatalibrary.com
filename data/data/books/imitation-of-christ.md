The world-renowned and universally recommended devotional / prayer book. Read often by St. Therese of Lisieux, St. Thomas More, St. Ignatius of Loyola.

Imitation of Christ is the second most popular Christian book, after the Bible. It has been heartily recommended by countless priest and bishops, and was read regularly by many saints, including St. Therese of Lisieux.

This book is not meant to be read through quickly, but like the Bible itself, is meant to be read in small increments, prayerfully. One page reflected on carefully should be sufficient for a whole day.
