> Section III.
>
> *On Rash Judgments.*
>
> Those who are addicted to detraction and raillery do not confine themselves to what they know, but indulge in suppositions and rash judgments.
>
> When they no longer find matter to censure they invent evil intentions, misinterpret good actions, forgetting that our Saviour has said: "Judge not, that you may not be judged; for with what judgment you judge you shall be judged." [St. Matt. vii. 1, 2.]
>
> Here also the offence may frequently be a mortal sin, particularly when we venture to judge in a matter of grave importance upon very slight evidence.
>
> If it be only a suspicion, not a real judgment, it may be only a venial sin, because the act has not been completed.
>
> Even by suspicion, however, a mortal sin can be committed by suspecting virtuous persons of enormous crimes.
