**Overview**: Movie about St. Pedro Poveda who helped the poor and assisted young women in modern times.

**Review**: Interesting movie.

**Caveats**: Some scary scenes are inappropriate for children or sensitive viewers, such as an execution in the background more than halfway through the movie, and dead bodies shown at the end.
