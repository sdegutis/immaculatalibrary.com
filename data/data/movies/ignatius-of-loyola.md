**Overview**: Intense movie that captures the life and spirit of St. Ignatius of Loyola perfectly. Based very closely on his autobiography and other reliable sources, this film takes very few liberties, and much of the events and dialogue are verbatim.

**Review**: The few scenes where the filmmakers had no choice but to guess are very well chosen, and fit the overall spirit of this saint extremely accurately. Overall extremely inspiring and powerful movie.

**Caveats**: Not appropriate for young children! Deals with mature themes such as prostitution, suicide, extreme guilt and self-punishment, and had two gory scenes involving the amputation of his leg.
