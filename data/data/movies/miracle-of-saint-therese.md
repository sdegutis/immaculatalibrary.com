**Overview**: Good and wholesome family film about the Little Flower, St. Therese of Lisieux. The film admits in the beginning that it has to take certain liberties to get the same point across on screen as the book makes, but that you ought to read the Story of a Soul for the pure facts.

**Review**: It does a great job at showing the spirit of this great Saint and Doctor of the Church.

**Caveats**: Nothing questionable in this film, although there is a storm scene near the end that could be too much for very young viewers, and the death of her mother near the beginning can be a bit much too, though it is dealt with quickly and reverently.
