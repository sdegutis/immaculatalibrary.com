**Overview**: The last 12 hours of Jesus Christ, starting with the Agony in the Garden and ending with the Crucifixion and a glimpse of the Resurrection. Also contains almost all the 14 Stations of the Cross.

**Review**: This isn't quite a movie, it's more of a devotion. Don't watch this for entertainment, watch this prayerfully and with humility, and you will grow in love for God.

**Caveats**: Some parts could be skipped over safely without harm to devotion, such as the final Judas scene and the demonic scenes and jump-scares. In general, not appropriate for anyone younger than teenagers.
