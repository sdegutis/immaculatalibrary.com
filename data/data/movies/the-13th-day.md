**Overview**: The most accurate, beautiful, and moving film about Fatima. Made by independent filmmakers, so it has its strengths and weaknesses.

**Review**: Personally my favorite of all Fatima movies, with an especially beautiful miracle scene and general scenes of the Blessed Virgin.

**Caveats**: Mostly okay for people of all ages, but general persecutions, a diabolic vision shortly after the first visitation, and the vision of Hell and the future, are definitely too much for young children.
