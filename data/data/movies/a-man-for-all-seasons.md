**Overview**: The last 7 years of the life of St. Thomas More, centering on the conflict between King Henry VIII and the Catholic Church, and how Thomas More got caught in the middle of it unwillingly, and how he tried to escape danger without disobeying his conscience.

**Review**: Amazing movie that does justice to St. Thomas More's life, principles, integrity, understanding of conscience, of law, and of religion. Takes good portions of its dialogue straight from official sources, and takes very few liberties, but ones that seem very true to his spirit.

**Caveats**: Generally family friendly, although some of the ending parts may be too emotional for younger viewers, especially the in-jail family reunion and the execution.
