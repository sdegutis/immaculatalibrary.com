**Overview**: Sequel to [Bernadette](/movies/bernadette.html) (1988), showing the life and spirit of St. Bernadetter after she becomes a nun, all the way until her death.

**Review**: Interesting film. Seems to be accurate based on what we have learned about her.

**Caveats**: There is a graphic scene near the end that shows her treating a woman with breast cancer. Other mature themes make this movie inappropriate for viewers younger than teenagers.
