**Overview**: Short episodes containing a summary of the life of each saint. Intended for children but also inspiring for devout adults: a treat for the whole family.

**Review**: This collection of kids movies are actually very accurate and faithful to the events and the spirit of each saint, except for the 1980s-style banter and jokes that necessarily had to find their way into each episode.

**Caveats**: A few episodes have a few scary scenes which might be too much for young children.
